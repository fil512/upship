# UP SHIP!

## A Strategy Game of Aerial Engineering & Industrial Dominance

**The Golden Age of Airships: 1900–1937**

**2–4 Players | 90–120 Minutes**

---

# 1. OVERVIEW

Players act as Directors of rival Airship Conglomerates representing the great powers of the early 20th century: **Germany**, **Britain**, **the United States**, and **Italy**. Over three historical Ages, you must research technology, design airship blueprints, and launch fleets to claim routes on an evolving map.

**Victory Condition:** The player with the most **Victory Points** at the end of Age III wins.

**Game End Triggers:** The game ends immediately when ANY of the following occur:

1. **The Hindenburg Disaster:** A player fails a Hazard Check during a Luxury Launch in Age III while using a Hydrogen-equipped ship. The burning wreckage signals the end of public confidence in airship travel. Complete the current round, then proceed to final scoring.

2. **The Rise of Fixed-Wing Aircraft:** The Progress Track reaches its threshold (see Section 1.3). Heavier-than-air craft have become viable competitors, rendering airships obsolete. Complete the current round, then proceed to final scoring.

**Tiebreakers:** If players are tied for Victory Points, apply the following in order until the tie is broken:
1. Highest Income Track position
2. Most Cash on hand
3. Most ships currently on the map

### 1.1 Thematic Pillars

- **Engineering Reality:** The physics of Lift vs. Weight determines what you can fly
- **Industrial Management:** You run a factory, not just one ship—your Blueprint represents your current manufacturing capability
- **Historical Narrative:** Progress through the Pioneer Era, the Great War, and the Golden Age of luxury liners
- **Risk Management:** Every launch is a test of your engineering against the elements

### 1.2 Core Inspirations

The game draws mechanics from:
- **Eclipse:** Tech tracks with specialization discounts, separate technologies and upgrades, blueprint customization
- **Dune: Imperium:** Deck building, worker placement, and end-of-round contests
- **Brass: Lancashire:** Age-based route obsolescence, loan economy, and network building
- **Ticket to Ride:** Route claiming and network expansion

### 1.3 The Progress Track (Fixed-Wing Competition)

A shared track on the board represents the advancement of heavier-than-air aviation. Each time any player acquires a Technology Tile, advance the Progress marker by 1 space. The Progress Track serves two purposes: triggering Age transitions and determining game end.

| Player Count | Age I Ends | Age II Ends | Game Ends |
|--------------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| 2 Players    | 8          | 16          | 20        |
| 3 Players    | 10         | 20          | 25        |
| 4 Players    | 12         | 24          | 30        |

When the marker reaches or exceeds an Age threshold, that Age ends after the current round (see Section 9 for Age Transition procedures). When the marker reaches or exceeds the Game End threshold, the game ends after the current round.

**Thematic Note:** Every breakthrough in aviation technology—whether for airships or not—brings fixed-wing aircraft closer to commercial viability. Your innovations hasten your own obsolescence. The more aggressively players pursue technology, the faster the Ages advance.

### 1.4 Player Count Scaling

The game adjusts for different player counts:

| Component | 2 Players | 3 Players | 4 Players |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| R&D Board tiles | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| Market Row cards | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| Starting Cash | £18 | £15 | £12 |
| Map routes | Use 2P markers | Standard | Standard |

**2-Player Rules:** Some single-track routes are marked "3-4P only" and are unavailable in 2-player games. This maintains competition over limited routes.

---

# 3. THE PLAYER BOARD (The Factory Interface)

Your Player Board represents your corporation's infrastructure. It is divided into four zones:

## 3.1 Zone 1: The Drawing Office (Left Side)

Your personal Technology display. When you acquire Technologies from the R&D Board, place them here organized by track (Propulsion, Structure, Gas Systems, Payload).

**Technology Tracks:** Your Drawing Office has four horizontal tracks:
- **Propulsion Track:** Engine and drive technologies
- **Structure Track:** Frame, hull, and safety systems
- **Gas Systems Track:** Lifting gas and fuel technologies
- **Payload Track:** Passenger, cargo, and mission equipment

**Specialization Discount:** The more Technologies you have in a single track, the cheaper subsequent Technologies in that track become:

| Technologies in Track | Research Discount |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| 1-2 | None |
| 3-4 | -1 Research |
| 5+ | -2 Research |

**Key Point:** Technologies never expire. You can use an old "Daimler Engine" technology into Age III, but its poor weight-to-power ratio will make the resulting upgrades inefficient for longer routes.

## 3.2 Zone 2: The Blueprint (Center)

An Age-specific overlay representing your current Airship Model—your "Factory Standard."

### Age-Specific Blueprints

Each Age, you replace your Blueprint overlay with the new Age's version. Blueprints have **printed baseline components** representing standard manufacturing capability for that era:

**Age I Blueprint (Pioneer Era):**
- Pre-printed: Basic Gas Cell (Hydrogen, Lift 4), Primitive Engine (Speed 1, Range 1)
- Open Slots: 1 Drive, 1 Structure, 1 Payload
- Baseline Stats: Lift 4, Speed 1, Range 1, Ceiling 0, Reliability 0

**Age II Blueprint (Great War):**
- Pre-printed: Standard Gas Cell (Hydrogen, Lift 6), Military Engine (Speed 2, Range 2)
- Open Slots: 2 Drive, 2 Structure, 2 Payload
- Baseline Stats: Lift 6, Speed 2, Range 2, Ceiling 1, Reliability 1

**Age III Blueprint (Golden Age):**
- Pre-printed: Large Gas Cell (Hydrogen, Lift 8), Modern Engine (Speed 3, Range 3)
- Open Slots: 2 Drive, 2 Structure, 3 Payload
- Baseline Stats: Lift 8, Speed 3, Range 3, Ceiling 2, Reliability 2

**Historical Blueprint Designs:** Each Blueprint overlay has a distinctive silhouette reflecting the actual airship designs of that era:
- **Age I:** Small, cigar-shaped designs with minimal structure (non-rigid or semi-rigid designs)
- **Age II:** Longer, more refined shapes with visible frame structure (transitional rigid designs)
- **Age III:** Massive streamlined forms with pronounced passenger gondolas (fully rigid giants)

Additionally, each faction's Blueprint boards reflect their historical design philosophy:
- **Germany:** Rigid frame Zeppelin configurations with maximum gas cell capacity
- **Britain:** Distinctive R-series designs with passenger comfort emphasis
- **United States:** Military-influenced designs with robust structural elements
- **Italy:** Semi-rigid designs with unique keel structures (Nobile pattern)

### The Physics Check (The Golden Rule)

You cannot launch a ship if its design is physically impossible:

> **Total Lift ≥ Total Weight**

If your Blueprint violates this rule, your ship cannot leave the ground.

### Ship Stats at Launch

Ships in your Hangar Bay are generic airship tokens—they don't track individual stats. When you **launch** a ship, it uses your **current Blueprint stats** at that moment. This means you can build ships now, upgrade your Blueprint later, and launch with the improved design. No bookkeeping required.

## 3.3 Zone 3: The Barracks (Bottom)

Storage for your crew tokens earned from the shared supply:

- **Pilots:** Required to launch a ship. When you launch a ship, you spend 1 Pilot token from your Barracks back to the shared supply. Pilots are only returned to your Barracks when:
  1. An Age ends (all ships are removed from the map)
  2. You voluntarily ground one of your ships

- **Engineers:** Multi-purpose specialists that serve two functions:
  1. **Research Generation:** At the end of each round during the Reveal Phase, your available Research to acquire Technologies equals your number of Engineers in your Barracks plus any Research bonuses from cards remaining in your hand
  2. **Emergency Response:** May be spent reactively during Hazard Checks to prevent crashes under certain circumstances (see Section 7)

**The Engineer's Dilemma:** Engineers are expensive to recruit and maintain, but they are essential for acquiring new Technologies. Spending Engineers on emergencies saves ships but reduces your innovation capacity next round.

## 3.4 Zone 4: The Hangar Bay (Adjacent to Barracks)

A holding area for ships you have built but not yet launched:

- **Capacity:** Up to 3 ships can wait in your Hangar Bay
- **Building Ships:** When you take the Construction Hall action, built ships are placed here
- **Launching Ships:** When you take the Launchpad action, all ships in your Hangar Bay are launched simultaneously
- **Current Stats:** Ships use your current Blueprint stats when launched (no individual tracking needed)

**Strategic Value:** Building ships across multiple rounds then launching together lets you claim multiple routes in one action. You can even upgrade your Blueprint between building and launching!

## 3.5 Zone 5: Gas Reserve (Adjacent to Hangar Bay)

Storage for lifting gas purchased in advance:

- **Hydrogen Tokens:** Standard lifting gas, cheaper but flammable
- **Helium Tokens:** Safe lifting gas, more expensive (requires Helium Handling technology)
- **Usage:** When building ships at the Construction Hall, use stored gas first. Any deficit must be purchased at current market price.
- **Strategic Value:** Buy gas when market prices are low; use stored gas to avoid price spikes or Helium shortages

## 3.6 Zone 6: Economy Tracks (Right Edge)

- **Income Track:** Tracks your current £ earned per round from routes
- **Pilot Income Track:** Tracks free Pilots gained per round (starts at 1)
- **Engineer Income Track:** Tracks free Engineers gained per round (starts at 1)
- **Loan Marker:** Tracks penalties from loans taken

## 3.7 Zone 7: Blueprint Stat Tracks (Adjacent to Blueprint)

Your Player Board includes dedicated tracks for monitoring your current Blueprint's statistics. As you install or remove Upgrade tiles, adjust tracking cubes on these tracks to reflect your ship's current capabilities:

- **Lift Track:** Current total lifting capacity (minimum 0, maximum varies by Age)
- **Weight Track:** Current total weight of all components (minimum 0, maximum varies by Age)
- **Speed Track:** Current speed rating (minimum 0, maximum varies by design)
- **Range Track:** Current range rating (minimum 0, maximum varies by design)
- **Ceiling Track:** Current altitude ceiling (minimum 0, maximum varies by design)
- **Reliability Track:** Current reliability rating (minimum 0, maximum varies by design)
- **Luxury Track:** Current luxury rating for passenger comfort (minimum 0, maximum varies by design)

**Usage:** These tracks provide at-a-glance visibility of whether your Blueprint passes the Physics Check (Lift â‰¥ Weight) and meets route requirements without having to manually count tile bonuses.

---

# 4. THE TECHNOLOGY & UPGRADE SYSTEM

The game distinguishes between **Technologies** (knowledge your company has acquired) and **Upgrades** (physical components installed on your Blueprint).

## 4.1 Technologies

Technologies represent patents, expertise, and manufacturing capability. They are acquired from the R&D Board and stored in your Drawing Office.

**Technology Tile Attributes:**
- **Research Cost:** How much Research to acquire
- **Track:** Which Drawing Office track it belongs to (Propulsion/Structure/Gas/Payload)
- **Age:** Minimum Age when this technology becomes available
- **Unlocks:** Which Upgrade tiles this technology allows you to install
- **£ Value:** Income generated during Age Transitions (all tiles have this)
- **VP Value:** Victory Points scored at each Age end (only some tiles have this)

| Age | Typical £ Value | Typical VP Value |
|-----|-----------------|------------------|
| Age I | £1 | 0-1 VP (most are 0) |
| Age II | £1-2 | 0-3 VP (essential techs are 0, niche techs are 2-3) |
| Age III | £2-3 | 0-3 VP (essential techs are 0, niche techs are 2-3) |

### The R&D Board

A shared display where available Technologies are placed. At the start of each round, draw tiles from the Technology Bag to fill empty spaces:

| Age | Tiles Drawn Per Round |
|-----|----------------------|
| Age I | 4 tiles |
| Age II | 5 tiles |
| Age III | 6 tiles |

Technologies from previous Ages remain available (older tech doesn't disappear), but the bag only contains tiles appropriate to the current Age.

### Acquiring Technologies

During the **Reveal Phase** at the end of each round:
- **Calculate Research Budget:** Your total available Research equals the number of Engineers in your Barracks plus any Research bonuses printed on cards remaining in your hand
- **Spend Research:** You may spend this Research to acquire one or more Technologies from the R&D Board
- **Cost:** Pay Research equal to the tile's cost (minus any specialization discount)
- **Use It Or Lose It:** Unspent Research does not carry over to the next round
- **Result:** Add acquired tiles to the appropriate track in your Drawing Office
- **Progress:** Advance the Progress Track by 1 for each Technology acquired

**Example:** You have 3 Engineers in your Barracks and reveal 2 cards with Research bonuses (+1 and +2). Your total Research budget is 6. You could acquire a 4-cost Technology and a 2-cost Technology, or a single 6-cost Technology (assuming no specialization discounts).

## 4.2 Upgrades

Upgrades are the physical components you install on your Blueprint. Each Upgrade tile type has a corresponding Technology that must be in your Drawing Office before you can install it.

**Upgrade Tile Attributes:**
- **Weight:** How much Lift is consumed (negative number)
- **Stats:** Bonuses to Speed, Range, Ceiling, Reliability, or Income
- **Special Effects:** Unique abilities (e.g., "Flammable," "Safe," "Luxury")
- **Required Tech:** Which Technology tile you must own to install this

### The Upgrade Supply

A shared supply of Upgrade tiles organized by type. Unlike Technologies, Upgrades are not limited—if you have the required Technology, you can always install the corresponding Upgrade (unless physically out of components).

### Installing Upgrades (The Upgrade Action)

Visit **The Design Bureau** on the Ground Board:
- **Action:** Modify your Blueprint
- **Cost:** Free (but limited swaps per action)
- **Swaps Allowed:** 2 tile installations or removals per action (cards and abilities can increase this)
- **Constraint:** You may only install Upgrades for which you own the corresponding Technology

**Examples of Upgrade Actions:**
- Install 2 new tiles (2 swaps, the base action)
- Remove 1 tile and install 2 new tiles (3 swaps, requires a card bonus)
- Install 4 new tiles (4 swaps, requires Italy's Rapid Refit or multiple card bonuses)

**Removed Tiles:** When you remove an Upgrade from your Blueprint, return it to the shared Upgrade Supply. You retain the Technology and can reinstall the same Upgrade type later.

## 4.3 Technology → Upgrade Examples

| Technology (Drawing Office) | Unlocks Upgrade (Blueprint) |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Maybach Engine Design | Maybach CX Engine: Speed +2, Range +1, Weight -2 |
| Helium Handling | Helium Gas Cell: Lift +5, Safe, Weight -1 |
| Passenger Gondola | Luxury Cabin: Income +3, Luxury +2, Weight -3 |
| Duralumin Framework | Rigid Frame: Reliability +2, Ceiling +1, Weight -2 |

## 4.4 Lifting Gas: The Critical Resource

Historically, helium was so scarce that the first American airship to use it (USS Shenandoah) contained most of the world's supply. This scarcity is reflected in the game.

**Hydrogen** is the default. All Blueprint base Gas Cells use Hydrogen. It provides excellent lift but is **Flammable**—ships using hydrogen are vulnerable to fire-related Hazard cards and the Hindenburg Disaster game-end condition.

**Helium** requires the *Helium Handling* Technology. Once acquired, you can install Helium Gas Cell upgrades. There is a Helium Market Track on the board:
- The first few units cost £2 each
- As the market empties, prices rise to £4, £6, £10+
- You must pay this cost each time you Launch a Helium ship

**Strategic Choice:** Build fast and cheap with dangerous hydrogen, or invest in the safety of helium?

# 5. THE MAPS

The game features three physical map boards, one for each Age. When an Age ends, the map is replaced, all ships on it are removed, and players lose the Income from those routes.

## 5.1 Age I: The Cradle (Western Europe)

**Scale:** Regional (zoomed in)
**Geography:** Southern England, Northern France, Western Germany (The Rhineland)
**Theme:** Picturesque but dangerous. You are flying low over rivers because your engines are weak.

**Route Characteristics:**
- Short, winding river routes
- Low stat requirements
- Focus on **Reliability** (can you fly 100km without your engine seizing up?)

**Placement Rule:** No home bases. Players can launch to *any* unclaimed route on the map (the Pioneer Scramble).

## 5.2 Age II: The Great War (Greater Europe)

**Scale:** Continental (mid-zoom)
**Geography:** Extends to Scapa Flow (Scotland), the Russian Front (Warsaw), and the Mediterranean
**Theme:** Hostile and industrial. The war has transformed civilian aviation.

**Route Characteristics:**
- Direct routes requiring high altitude
- "War Zone" routes requiring Armor
- Government contracts provide lump sum bonuses

**Placement Rule:** Players **must** launch their first ship of this Age from their **National Capital** (Berlin, London, Rome, or Paimboeuf, France). Subsequent ships must connect to your existing network.

## 5.3 Age III: The Golden Age (The Atlantic)

**Scale:** Hemispheric (zoomed out)
**Geography:** North Atlantic, US East Coast, Brazil, Europe, routes to India
**Theme:** Majestic luxury liners spanning oceans.

**Route Characteristics:**
- Massive ocean crossings (Distance 4, 5, or 6)
- Focus on **Range** and **Luxury**
- Competition for the "Blue Riband" (fastest Atlantic crossing)
- **Luxury Routes:** Some routes require the Luxury stat and trigger Luxury Launch rules

**Placement Rule:** Players can launch from **any Major Metropolis** (New York, London, Berlin, Rio), regardless of nationality.

## 5.4 Route Requirements

Routes do not use simple color-coding. Instead, each route has **Minimum Stats** printed on the map:

| Example Route | Requirements |
|---------------|--------------|
| Hamburg → Berlin | Range 1 |
| London → Paris | Speed 2, Range 1 |
| London → New York | Range 5, Ceiling 3 |
| New York → Rio (Luxury) | Range 4, Luxury 2 |

Your Blueprint stats must meet or exceed **all** listed requirements to claim a route.

## 5.5 Route Capacity

- **Single Track:** Only 1 player can claim (first come, first served)
- **Double Track:** Up to 2 players can claim the same connection
- Routes are exclusive monopolies until the Age ends or your ship crashes

**Simultaneous Claims:** If multiple players attempt to claim the same single-track route in the same round, resolve by turn order—earlier players claim first. Later players may redirect to a different valid route before paying costs, or forfeit their action.

## 5.6 Route Income Values

When you claim a route, increase your Income Track by the route's Income value. Income values are printed on each route and follow this formula:

> **Route Income = Range requirement + Age bonus + Luxury bonus**

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Range requirement | £1 per Range point |
| Age II bonus | +£1 |
| Age III bonus | +£2 |
| Luxury route bonus | +£2 |

**Example Routes:**

| Route | Range | Age | Luxury | Income |
|-------|-------|-----|--------|--------|
| Hamburg → Berlin | 1 | I | No | £1 |
| London → Paris | 2 | I | No | £2 |
| Berlin → Moscow | 3 | II | No | £4 |
| London → New York | 5 | III | Yes | £9 |
| New York → Rio | 4 | III | Yes | £8 |

**Design Target:** Ships should pay for themselves within 3-5 rounds of operation.

---

# 6. THE GAME LOOP

The game is played in **Rounds**. Each round follows this structure:

## 6.1 Phase A: Worker Placement (Ground Operations)

Players take turns placing **one Agent** at a time until all players pass. To place an Agent, you must play a **Card** from your hand that matches the location's icon.

### Turn Order

At the start of each round, determine turn order based on **Income Track position** (lowest goes first). This creates a catch-up mechanism: struggling players get first choice of actions.

**Ties:** If players are tied on Income, the player with less Cash goes first. If still tied, maintain previous turn order.

**First Round:** Determine randomly or by historical precedent (Germany first, as Count Zeppelin flew in 1900).

### Ground Board Locations:

The Ground Board has 12 action spaces, each marked with one of three symbols. To visit a space, you must play a card showing that symbol.

**Symbol Types:**
- **Wrench (Technical):** Engineering and construction activities
- **Coin (Business):** Financial and personnel activities
- **Propeller (Operations):** Research and flight activities

---

**1. The Research Institute (Propeller)**
- **Action:** Purchase Research with money
- **Cost:** £3 per Research point (or £2 if you played a Researcher card for this action)
- **Effect:** Gain Research tokens that can be spent this round during Technology acquisition in the Reveal Phase
- **Strategic Note:** This provides an alternate path for cash-rich, engineer-poor players to acquire Technologies

**2. The Design Bureau (Wrench)**
- **Action:** Modify your Blueprint (install/remove Upgrades)
- **Cost:** Free
- **Limit:** 2 tile swaps per action (cards and abilities can increase this)
- **Constraint:** Can only install Upgrades for Technologies you own

**3. The Construction Hall (Wrench)**
- **Action:** Build ships
- **Cost:** Production Cost (£ based on Blueprint complexity) + Lifting Gas per ship
- **Limit:** Build up to 3 ships per action (if you have the Pilots and funds)
- **Gas Payment:** Use stored gas from your Gas Reserve first; any deficit must be purchased at current market price
- **Effect:** For each ship built, spend 1 Pilot from your Barracks and pay costs. Built ships are placed in your **Hangar Bay**, waiting to be launched.
- **Note:** Ships in your Hangar Bay use your current Blueprint stats when launched (no individual stat tracking)

**4. The Launchpad (Propeller)**
- **Action:** Launch all ships from your Hangar Bay
- **Cost:** Free (costs were paid during building)
- **Effect:** Launch all ships currently in your Hangar Bay simultaneously. Each ship must:
  1. Pass an individual Hazard Check (draw one Hazard Card per ship)
  2. Be assigned to a valid route that meets its requirements
- **Result:** Ships that pass their Hazard Checks are placed on routes; increase Income Track for each successful placement
- **Strategic Note:** Building multiple ships then launching together lets you claim multiple routes in one action, but you risk multiple Hazard Checks in sequence

**5. The Academy (Coin)**
- **Action:** Recruit crew from the shared supply
- **Cost:** £2 per Pilot, £3 per Engineer
- **Result:** Gain Pilot or Engineer tokens from the shared supply to your Barracks
- **Note:** Pilots are cheaper because they are consumed when launching ships; Engineers persist and generate ongoing Research

**6. The Flight School (Coin)**
- **Action:** Expand your pilot training program
- **Cost:** £5 per level
- **Effect:** Increase your Pilot Income track by 1 step
- **Strategic Note:** Investing in Pilot Income provides a steady stream of free Pilots each round, reducing reliance on the Academy

**7. The Technical Institute (Wrench)**
- **Action:** Expand your engineering program
- **Cost:** £6 per level
- **Effect:** Increase your Engineer Income track by 1 step
- **Strategic Note:** Investing in Engineer Income provides free Engineers each round, fueling your Research capacity without ongoing recruitment costs

**8. The Bank (Coin)**
- **Action:** Take a loan
- **Effect:** Gain £30 immediately
- **Penalty:** Reduce Income Track by 3 steps

**9. The Ministry (Propeller)**
- **Action:** Political maneuvering
- **Effect:** Various special actions (claim bonus rewards, change turn order)

**10. The Gas Depot (Wrench)**
- **Action:** Purchase lifting gas for storage
- **Cost:** Current market price per unit (Hydrogen or Helium)
- **Effect:** Add gas tokens to your Gas Reserve on your Player Board
- **Strategic Note:** Buy gas when prices are low; stored gas can be used later when building ships, avoiding market price spikes

**11. The Insurance Bureau (Coin)**
- **Action:** Purchase insurance policies
- **Cost:** £3 per policy card
- **Effect:** Take policy cards and place them face-up near your Player Board
- **Policy Benefit:** When one of your ships fails a Hazard Check, you may discard one policy card to recover the airship token to your Hangar Bay. You still lose the Pilot and any gas spent, but you keep the ship for another attempt.
- **Strategic Note:** Insurance is valuable for expensive ships or risky launches—it lets you try again without rebuilding from scratch

**12. The Weather Bureau (Propeller)**
- **Action:** Consult weather forecasts
- **Cost:** £2
- **Effect:** Look at the top card of your personal Hazard Deck. You may either leave it on top or move it to the bottom of the deck.
- **Strategic Note:** Plan your launches around favorable weather, or bury dangerous hazards for later

## 6.2 Phase B: Reveal & Acquisition

After all players pass, the round enters the Reveal Phase:

### Step 1: Reveal Hands
All players simultaneously reveal the cards remaining in their hands (cards not used for worker placement).

### Step 2: Calculate Resources
- **Influence (Diamond Icons):** Sum all Influence icons on revealed cards. Use Influence to buy new cards from the Market Row.
- **Research (from Engineers + Cards + Purchases):** Your total available Research equals: the number of Engineers currently in your Barracks, plus any Research bonuses printed on cards remaining in your hand, plus any Research tokens purchased at the Research Institute this round. This is a "use it or lose it" budget for acquiring Technologies.

**Note on Ops:** Cards with Ops icons are NOT revealed here. Ops are used reactively during Hazard Checks (see Section 7)—cards you play from hand during a launch are discarded, not revealed. The decision to save high-Ops cards for risky launches versus using them for worker placement is a key tactical choice.

### Step 3: Acquire Technologies
Players may spend their Research budget to acquire one or more Technologies from the R&D Board:
- Pay Research equal to each tile's cost (minus any specialization discount)
- Add acquired tiles to the appropriate track in your Drawing Office
- Advance the Progress Track by 1 for each Technology acquired
- Unspent Research is lost

### Step 4: Purchase Cards
Players may spend Influence to buy cards from the Market Row. Purchased cards go to your discard pile.

## 6.3 Phase C: Income & Cleanup

1. **Pay Engineer Upkeep:** Deduct £1 per Engineer in your Barracks from your income
2. **Collect Income:** Each player gains £ equal to their Income Track position (minus Engineer upkeep)
3. **Collect Crew Income:** Each player gains Pilots equal to their Pilot Income Track, and Engineers equal to their Engineer Income Track
4. **Refresh R&D Board:** Draw new Technology tiles from the bag to fill empty R&D Board spaces
5. **Check Age Transition:** If the Progress Track has reached or exceeded the current Age threshold, trigger Age Transition (see Section 9)
6. **Refresh Agents:** Return all Agents to player supplies
7. **Draw Cards:** Shuffle discard pile into deck if needed; draw back to hand size (typically 5)
8. **Refill Markets:** Refill the Card Market Row

---

# 7. BUILDING AND LAUNCHING SHIPS

Ships are constructed at the Construction Hall and launched from the Launchpad. This two-step process lets you build multiple ships and launch them together.

## 7.1 The Build Procedure (Construction Hall Action)

When you take the **Construction Hall Action**, you construct ships:

1. **Verify Physics Check:** Your Blueprint must satisfy Total Lift ≥ Total Weight
2. **Pay Costs Per Ship:** For each ship you build, pay:
   - Production Cost (£ based on Blueprint complexity)
   - Lifting Gas cost (from Gas Reserve first, then market price for any deficit)
3. **Spend Pilot Per Ship:** Return 1 Pilot token from your Barracks to the shared supply for each ship
4. **Place in Hangar Bay:** Built ships are placed in your Hangar Bay, waiting for launch

**No Stat Tracking:** Ships in your Hangar Bay are generic tokens. When launched, they use your current Blueprint stats—you can upgrade between building and launching!

**Build Limit:** You may build up to 3 ships per Construction Hall action (limited by your available Pilots and funds).

## 7.2 The Launch Procedure (Launchpad Action)

When you take the **Launchpad Action**, all ships in your Hangar Bay are launched:

1. **Assign Routes:** Declare which route each ship will attempt (each ship must meet the route's stat requirements)
2. **Resolve Hazard Checks:** For each ship, in the order you choose:
   - Draw a Hazard Card from your personal Hazard Deck
   - Resolve the Hazard Check (see 7.3)
3. **Place Successful Ships:** Ships that pass are placed on their assigned routes; increase your Income Track
4. **Failed Ships:** Ships that fail their Hazard Check are returned to your supply (you lose the Pilot and costs already paid)

**Strategic Timing:** You can hold ships in your Hangar Bay across multiple rounds, waiting for favorable conditions or saving Ops cards for a mass launch.

## 7.3 Resolving Hazard Checks

Each Hazard Card shows a **Challenge Type** and **Difficulty Rating**:
- *Example:* "Strong Headwind — Requires Speed 3"
- *Example:* "Icing Conditions — Requires Ceiling 2"
- *Example:* "Clear Skies — Auto Pass"

**Calculate Your Total:**
> Ship's Relevant Stat + Ops from cards played from hand

**Playing Ops:** After seeing the Hazard Card, you may play any number of cards from your hand and add their Ops icons to your total. Cards played this way are discarded immediately—they will NOT be available during the Reveal Phase.

**Reactive Engineer Spending:** After seeing the Hazard Card and calculating your initial total (including any Ops you choose to play), you may spend Engineer tokens from your Barracks to prevent crashes under certain circumstances. The specific ways Engineers can help will depend on the Hazard Card type (see individual card text for details).

**The Dilemma:**
- Cards with high Ops values are your safety net for risky launches—but playing them means losing their Influence bonuses during the Reveal Phase
- Engineers spent now won't generate Research during the Reveal Phase
- This creates a meaningful choice: Do you save your best cards for the end of round, or spend them to ensure a safe launch?

- **Pass:** If your total meets or exceeds the Difficulty, the ship is successfully launched. Place it on the route and increase your Income Track.
- **Fail:** If your total is less than the Difficulty, the launch fails. The ship returns to your supply (you keep the ship token), but you lose all costs paid including the Pilot already spent.

**Mass Launch Note:** When launching multiple ships, you may use the same Ops cards to help multiple Hazard Checks (cards stay in hand until you choose to discard them), but Engineers spent are gone for subsequent checks that round.

## 7.4 Luxury Launches (Age III)

Routes marked as **Luxury Routes** require ships with the Luxury stat and trigger special rules:

**Luxury Launch Requirements:**
- Your Blueprint must have at least one Payload upgrade with the **Luxury** trait
- The route must show a Luxury requirement you can meet

**The Hindenburg Risk:** If you fail a Hazard Check during a Luxury Launch while your ship uses **Hydrogen** (including the printed base Gas Cell), the game immediately triggers the **Hindenburg Disaster** end condition.

**Thematic Note:** A luxury liner full of passengers catching fire over a crowded landing field is a catastrophe that ends public trust in airship travel forever.

**Safe Alternative:** Ships using **Helium Gas Cells** (from the Helium Handling technology) do not trigger the Hindenburg Disaster on failed Luxury Launches—the fire simply doesn't happen. The launch still fails, but the game continues.

# 8. THE DECK-BUILDING SYSTEM

Every card in the game has **dual functionality**, creating constant tension between using cards for actions versus saving them for the reveal phase.

## 8.1 Card Anatomy

| Section | Location | Function |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Agent Symbol** | Top Left | One of three symbols (Wrench/Coin/Propeller) determining which action spaces you can visit |
| **Agent Effect** | Middle | Bonus when using this card for worker placement |
| **Reveal Effect** | Bottom | Influence and/or Ops icons generated when revealed |

**The Three Symbols:**
- **Wrench (Technical):** Design Bureau, Construction Hall, Technical Institute, Gas Depot
- **Coin (Business):** Academy, Flight School, Bank, Insurance Bureau
- **Propeller (Operations):** Research Institute, Launchpad, Ministry, Weather Bureau

## 8.2 The Core Decision

When you draw a card, you must decide:
- **Use it for Worker Placement:** Send an Agent to a matching location (same symbol), trigger the Agent Effect, but the card is discarded (no reveal benefit)
- **Save it for Reveal:** Keep it in hand until end of round to generate Influence (for buying cards) and/or Ops (for Hazard Checks)

**Symbol Tension:** To build ships AND launch them in the same round, you need both Wrench cards (for Construction Hall) and Propeller cards (for Launchpad). Managing your hand's symbol mix is critical.

## 8.3 Starter Deck (10 Cards)

Every player begins with these basic cards representing primitive but essential capabilities:

| Card | Qty | Symbol | Agent Effect | Reveal |
|------|-----|--------|--------------|--------|
| **Apprentice** | 2 | Any | None | 1 Influence |
| **Mechanic** | 2 | Wrench | +1 Reliability for this launch | 1 Ops |
| **Draftsman** | 2 | Wrench | +1 tile swap this action | 1 Influence |
| **Researcher** | 2 | Propeller | Research costs £2 instead of £3 | 1 Ops |
| **Purser** | 1 | Coin | Gain £2 | 2 Influence |
| **Co-Pilot** | 1 | Propeller | +1 to Hazard Check | 2 Ops |

## 8.4 Market Deck Categories

The Market Row offers more powerful cards in several categories:

**Technical Support (High Ops)**
- Cards that help pass Hazard Checks and provide safety margins during risky launches
- Example: *Chief Engineer* — Wrench: +2 tile swaps. Reveal: 3 Ops

**Political Backing (High Influence)**
- Cards that help purchase expensive upgrades
- Example: *The Aristocrat* — Coin: Gain £5. Reveal: 3 Influence

**Operational Efficiency**
- Cards that reduce costs or provide special abilities
- Example: *Test Pilot* — Propeller: Ignore the Hazard card completely. Reveal: 1 Ops

**Research & Development**
- Cards that accelerate technology acquisition
- Example: *University Partnership* — Propeller: Research costs £1 each. Reveal: 2 Influence, 1 Ops

**Organizations & Institutions**
- Expensive, powerful cards representing major backing
- Example: *Royal Geographic Society* — Wrench: Install an Upgrade ignoring Technology requirements. Reveal: 2 Influence, 2 Ops

# 9. THE AGE TRANSITIONS

## 9.1 Triggering the Transition

Each Age ends when the Progress Track reaches or exceeds the Age threshold (see Section 1.3 for thresholds by player count). The transition is checked during the Income & Cleanup phase, after Technologies are acquired but before Agents are refreshed. When an Age ends:

1. **Scoring:** All players score VP for routes and Technology tiles (see Section 12.7).
2. **Route Wipe:** Remove the current Map. All ships on it are returned to player supplies.
3. **Transition Income:** Calculate your starting Income for the next Age:
   > **New Income = (£ from Technology tiles) − (£1 × number of routes lost)**

   Each Technology tile shows a £ value representing licensing fees and consulting contracts. Each route you lose costs £1 in restructuring. Set your Income Track to this value (minimum £0).

   *Example: You have Technologies worth £5 total and lost 2 routes. Your new Income = £5 − £2 = £3.*

4. **Pilot Recovery:** All Pilots spent on ships return to player Barracks.
5. **Blueprint Transition:** Replace your Blueprint overlay with the new Age's version. You may transfer Upgrade tiles from your old Blueprint to your new Blueprint for free (subject to slot availability and the Physics Check). Upgrades not transferred return to the supply. Technologies are always retained.
6. **Map Setup:** Place the new Age's Map.
7. **Technology Bag Update:** Add the new Age's Technology tiles to the bag.
8. **R&D Board Refresh:** Draw tiles to fill the R&D Board.

## 9.2 The Strategic Challenge

The Age Transition creates a "ticking clock" forcing difficult decisions:
- Do you invest in routes for VP, knowing each one costs £1 at transition?
- Do you acquire Technologies for their £ values to cushion the transition?
- Can you balance short-term route income with long-term Technology investment?
- Your Technologies carry forward, but your Upgrades don't—plan ahead

# 10. THE FOUR FACTIONS

Each nation has a unique starting Blueprint configuration, special technology, and distinct playstyle.

## 10.1 Germany (Luftschiffbau Zeppelin)

**Archetype:** The High-Stakes Engineers
**Philosophy:** Technological superiority at any cost. They build the biggest, fastest ships but must use dangerous hydrogen.

**Starting Advantage:** Maximum Lift slots. Their Blueprint overlays have the most Gas Cell slots across all Ages, allowing them to carry the heaviest engines and payloads.

**Starting Technology (pre-printed on Player Board):** *Blaugas Fuel System* — A special fuel that weighs the same as air. Unlocks the Blaugas Tank upgrade: you do not lose Lift as you burn fuel, allowing extreme Range.

**The Flaw:** *The Helium Embargo* — Germany cannot acquire the Helium Handling technology. They are permanently locked to Hydrogen (Flammable). In Age III, every Luxury Launch risks triggering the Hindenburg Disaster.

**Home Base (Age II):** Friedrichshafen

## 10.2 Britain (Royal Airship Works)

**Archetype:** The Imperial Bureaucrats
**Philosophy:** Connecting the Empire. Their ships are designed for comfort and long-haul sustainability.

**Starting Advantage:** *Pre-Installed Luxury* — Their Age I Blueprint includes a printed Dining Saloon component, generating steady VP/Income from Turn 1 and giving them an early Luxury stat.

**Starting Technology (pre-printed on Player Board):** *Imperial Mooring System* — Unlocks the Imperial Mast upgrade: Treat any British Territory (Egypt, Canada, India) as a Home Base for repair/refuel, extending effective range.

**The Flaw:** *Red Tape* — When taking the Upgrade Action at the Design Bureau, Britain may only make 1 tile swap instead of 2 (government inefficiency).

**Home Base (Age II):** Cardington

## 10.3 United States (Goodyear-Zeppelin)

**Archetype:** The Military Industrialists
**Philosophy:** Safety and power. They have access to strategic resources Europeans don't.

**Starting Advantage:** *Helium Monopoly* — The only faction that starts with the Helium Handling technology already in their Drawing Office. Their ships can be immune to Fire disaster cards and the Hindenburg Disaster.

**Starting Technology (pre-printed on Player Board):** *Trapeze Fighter System* — Unlocks the Sparrowhawk Hangar upgrade: A hangar for biplanes. When launching to a route, you may ignore one stat requirement (your fighter escorts compensate). Additionally, military routes in Age II provide +2 Income.

**The Flaw:** *Heavy Frame* — Helium lifts less than Hydrogen. All Helium Gas Cell upgrades provide -1 Lift compared to their Hydrogen equivalents, forcing smaller payloads or more gas cells.

**Home Base (Age II):** Paimboeuf, France

## 10.4 Italy (Nobile Construction)

**Archetype:** The Agile Explorers
**Philosophy:** Small is beautiful. They build nimble semi-rigid ships designed to dance through storms.

**Starting Advantage:** *Rapid Refit* — When taking the Upgrade Action, Italy may make up to 4 tile swaps instead of 2. They can reconfigure their Blueprint much faster than other nations.

**Starting Technology (pre-printed on Player Board):** *Articulated Keel Design* — Unlocks the Flexible Frame upgrade: Ignore Weather penalties on Hazard cards. When others are grounded by storms, you can fly.

**The Flaw:** *Low Ceiling* — Semi-rigid frames cannot support heavy payloads. Italy's Blueprint overlays have one fewer Payload slot than other factions. They must win on quantity, not quality.

**Home Base (Age II):** Rome

## 11.3 First Player

Determine first player randomly or by historical means (the German player, as Count Zeppelin flew first in 1900).

---

# 12. IMPORTANT RULES CLARIFICATIONS

## 12.1 Technologies vs. Upgrades

- **Technologies** are acquired with Research and stored in your Drawing Office permanently
- **Upgrades** are installed on your Blueprint and return to the supply when removed or at Age transitions
- You must own a Technology to install its corresponding Upgrade
- Technologies carry across Ages; Upgrades do not

## 12.2 No Direct Attacks

There are no "take that" mechanics. You cannot directly sabotage or destroy opponents' ships. Competition comes through:
- Racing to claim routes first
- Outbidding for Technologies
- Controlling the most profitable routes

## 12.3 Loans and Bankruptcy

If your Income Track goes negative (from loans, Engineer upkeep, or route losses), you must pay the difference from your Cash at the start of each Income phase. If you cannot pay, you must discard Technologies from your Drawing Office (they are removed from the game) until solvent.

## 12.4 Network Connectivity

- **Age I:** No connectivity required (pioneer scramble)
- **Age II:** First ship must launch from National Capital; subsequent ships must connect to your network
- **Age III:** May launch from any Major Hub; subsequent ships must connect to your network

## 12.5 The Hindenburg Disaster

When a player fails a Hazard Check during a Luxury Launch in Age III while using a Hydrogen ship:
1. The game end is triggered
2. Complete the current round normally
3. The player whose ship caused the disaster loses 5 VP
4. Proceed to final scoring

## 12.6 Engineer Timing

- Engineers generate Research during the Reveal Phase: your total available Research equals the number of Engineers in your Barracks plus any Research bonuses from cards
- Engineers may be spent reactively after a Hazard Card is drawn to prevent crashes under certain circumstances
- Engineers spent during a Hazard Check do not generate Research that round
- Engineer upkeep (£1 per Engineer) is paid at the start of the Income Phase based on Engineers currently in your Barracks

## 12.7 Victory Point Scoring

Victory Points are earned from **routes** and **Technology tiles**. All VP is scored at the **end of each Age** (before ships are removed), not at game end.

**Design Target:** Routes should contribute approximately **2/3 of total VP**, while Technologies contribute approximately **1/3**. This is achieved by:
- Increasing route VP values, especially for challenging routes
- Reducing Tech VP on highly useful technologies (you benefit from using them)
- Increasing Tech VP on niche/situational technologies (to compensate for limited practical value)

### Route Scoring

When an Age ends, score VP for each route you control. More challenging routes (higher Range requirements) are worth significantly more VP:

| Route Type | Age I | Age II | Age III |
|------------|-------|--------|---------|
| Short (Range 1-2) | 2 VP | 3 VP | 4 VP |
| Medium (Range 3-4) | 4 VP | 5 VP | 7 VP |
| Long (Range 5-6) | — | 7 VP | 10 VP |
| **Luxury Bonus** | — | — | +3 VP |

**Route VP Philosophy:** The harder the route, the greater the reward. Long-haul luxury routes in Age III (like London → New York) can be worth 13 VP, while short pioneer routes in Age I are worth only 2 VP.

### Technology Scoring

Technology tiles have **VP values printed on them** based on their practical utility:

| Utility Level | VP Value | Description |
|---------------|----------|-------------|
| **Essential** | 0 VP | Core technologies everyone needs (engines, frames, gas cells) |
| **Useful** | 1 VP | Good specialized technologies with clear benefits |
| **Niche** | 2-3 VP | Situational technologies with limited applications |

**The VP/Utility Tradeoff:** Highly useful technologies (like Helium Handling or Duralumin Framework) have 0 VP because their practical benefits are reward enough. Niche technologies (like Bomb Bay Design or Smoking Room) have higher VP to compensate for their limited usefulness.

**Note:** Technology VP is scored at every Age end, not just when acquired. Since Age I techs are scored 3 times, Age II techs 2 times, and Age III techs only once, earlier niche acquisitions accumulate more VP over time—but you sacrifice practical utility in the early game.

### Expected Score Ranges

| Category | Typical Range |
|----------|---------------|
| Route VP (all Ages combined) | 25-40 VP |
| Technology VP (all Ages combined) | 10-18 VP |
| **Winning Score (4 players)** | **40-55 VP** |

# 13. STRATEGY TIPS

## For New Players

1. **Don't Over-Engineer:** A ship that exceeds route requirements wastes resources. Build to spec.
2. **Balance Your Engineers:** More engineers mean more Research but higher upkeep costs. Find your equilibrium.
3. **Specialize Your Tech Tracks:** The discount for deep specialization is significant.
4. **Watch the Progress Track:** Every technology acquired hastens the game's end.
5. **Keep One Engineer for Emergencies:** You can spend them reactively to save critical launches.

## For Experienced Players

1. **The Germany Gambit:** High risk, high reward. Build monsters, but avoid Luxury Routes in Age III or accept the Hindenburg risk.
2. **The British Empire:** Your early Luxury stat lets you claim premium routes. Slow start on tech, strong finish.
3. **American Safety:** Your helium monopoly means you dominate Age III safely. Tech up on Payload to maximize it.
4. **Italian Flexibility:** Your 5-swap Upgrade action means you can pivot instantly. React to what others are doing.

# APPENDIX A: TODO LIST — Design Work Remaining

The following items require finalization before the game is complete:

## A.1 Component Design

1. **The 3 Maps:** Create vector artwork for Age I (Western Europe), Age II (Europe at War), Age III (The Atlantic). Include:
   - Route lines with stat requirements printed
   - Luxury Route indicators for Age III
   - City names and icons
   - Route capacity indicators (single/double track)
   - Foundry icons for cities with industrial bonuses

2. **Player Boards:** Design the 4 faction layouts with:
   - Drawing Office with 4 technology tracks and pre-printed faction-specific starting technology
   - Blueprint overlay socket
   - Barracks for crew tokens (earned from shared supply)
   - Economy tracks (Income track only - no Research track)
   - Blueprint stat tracking area with cube tracks for: Lift, Weight, Speed, Range, Ceiling, Reliability, Luxury (each with min/max values)

3. **Blueprint Overlays (12 total):** Design 3 per faction with:
   - Age-appropriate printed baseline components
   - Different slot configurations per faction
   - Clear slot type indicators
   - Historically accurate silhouettes:
     * Age I: Small, cigar-shaped non-rigid/semi-rigid designs
     * Age II: Longer, refined transitional rigid designs
     * Age III: Massive streamlined rigid giants with passenger gondolas
   - Faction-specific design elements:
     * Germany: Rigid Zeppelin configurations with max gas cell capacity
     * Britain: R-series designs with passenger comfort emphasis
     * USA: Military-influenced designs with robust structural elements
     * Italy: Semi-rigid designs with unique keel structures (Nobile pattern)

4. **Technology Tiles (~60):** Create tiles organized by track:
   - Propulsion: Engine technologies across Ages
   - Structure: Frame and safety technologies
   - Gas Systems: Hydrogen improvements, Helium handling
   - Payload: Cargo, passenger, and mission technologies

5. **Upgrade Tiles (~80):** Create tiles corresponding to each Technology:
   - Clear visual link between Technology and its Upgrades
   - Stat bonuses, weights, special abilities

6. **Progress Track:** Design the shared track with:
   - Numbered spaces to threshold
   - Player count indicators for different thresholds
   - Thematic "fixed-wing aircraft" imagery

7. **Iconography:** Create distinct icons for:
   - Research (Lightbulb or Beaker)
   - Ops (Gear)
   - Influence (Diamond)
   - Lift (Balloon)
   - Speed (Propeller)
   - Range (Fuel Gauge)
   - Reliability (Shield)
   - Ceiling (Altimeter)
   - Luxury (Champagne Glass)
   - Flammable (Flame warning)
   - Safe (Helium symbol)

## A.2 Card Design

1. **Personal Hazard Decks (20 cards each):** Each player gets identical deck. Finalize distribution:
   - ~8 Minor Hazards (Difficulty 2-3)
   - ~6 Major Hazards (Difficulty 4-5)
   - ~4 Clear Skies / Favorable conditions (Auto-pass)
   - ~2 Catastrophic Events (Difficulty 6+, Fire keyword)
   - Design cards to specify when/how Engineers can be spent to prevent crashes

2. **Market Deck:** Design 20-30 purchasable crew cards with:
   - Varied costs (2-8 Influence)
   - Balance between Ops-heavy and Influence-heavy reveals
   - Research bonus cards for tech acquisition strategies
   - **RESOLVED:** Ops are used for Hazard Checks during launches (see Section 7.2)

3. **Starter Deck Review:** Verify the 10-card starter deck provides:
   - Access to all Ground Board locations
   - Balance between Ops and Influence
   - Research Institute access

## A.3 Economy Balancing

1. **Research Costs:** Balance Technology prices:
   - Age I: 2-4 Research
   - Age II: 4-6 Research
   - Age III: 5-8 Research
   - Specialization discounts: -1 at 3+ tiles, -2 at 5+ tiles

2. **Engineer Economy:**
   - Starting Engineers: 2
   - Recruit cost: £4 per Engineer (see Section 6.1)
   - Upkeep cost: £1 per Engineer per round
   - Research generation: 1 per Engineer at Reveal
   - **Note:** Pilots cost £2 to recruit (cheaper because consumed on launch)

3. **Route Income Values:** Determine £ values for routes based on:
   - Distance/difficulty
   - Age
   - Strategic importance
   - Target: Ships should pay for themselves in ~3-5 turns

4. **Progress Track Thresholds:** **RESOLVED** - See Section 1.3 for complete table including Age transitions:
   - Age transitions at 8/16/20 (2P), 10/20/25 (3P), 12/24/30 (4P)
   - Test: Does game pacing feel appropriate across all Ages?

5. **Lifting Gas Market:** Set price scaling and:
   - Starting supply per Age
   - Replenishment rules
   - Faction-specific access (USA Helium monopoly)

## A.4 Gameplay Polish

1. **Age End Triggers:** **RESOLVED** - Progress Track milestones trigger Age transitions (see Section 1.3 and 9.1)

2. **Action Selection Mechanism:** Partially resolved:
   - Current system requires spending matching cards for worker placement
   - **RESOLVED:** Research Institute now allows purchasing Research with £ (see Section 6.1)
   - **RESOLVED:** Ops are used for Hazard Checks during launches (see Section 7.2)
   - Still needs testing: Is card-icon matching too restrictive? Consider Apprentice "Any" cards as wild

3. **Agent Count:** Determine appropriate number of agents per player after finalizing action spaces
   - Currently set at 3, but may need adjustment based on final action selection design

4. **Turn Order:** Define how first player rotates or changes

5. **Tie-Breakers:** Establish rules for ties in route claiming

6. **Player Count Scaling:** Adjust for 2, 3, and 4 players:
   - Available routes
   - Technology tile supply
   - R&D Board size
   - Progress Track threshold

7. **Hindenburg Disaster Tuning:**
   - Is -5 VP appropriate?
   - Should there be any positive outcome (historical notoriety)?

## A.5 Playtesting Priorities

1. **Engineer Economy Test:** Verify the tension between Research generation and emergency spending feels meaningful

2. **Progress Track Pacing:** Does the fixed-wing threshold create appropriate tension?

3. **Technology/Upgrade Flow:** Is the two-step system (acquire tech → install upgrade) intuitive?

4. **Hindenburg Drama:** Does the Age III hydrogen risk create exciting decisions?

5. **Faction Balance:** Ensure no faction dominates across all Ages

6. **Age Transition Impact:** Losing Upgrades but keeping Technologies—does this feel fair?

---

# APPENDIX B: QUICK REFERENCE

## Phase Order (Each Round)

1. **Worker Placement:** Take turns placing Agents (play cards to visit locations)
2. **Reveal:** Show remaining hands, calculate Influence and Research
3. **Acquire Technologies:** Spend Research (Engineers + card bonuses + purchased) on Technologies
4. **Purchase Cards:** Spend Influence on Market cards
5. **Income:** Pay Engineer upkeep, collect £ from Income Track
6. **Cleanup:** Refresh R&D Board, check Age transition, refresh Agents, draw cards

## Build Checklist (Construction Hall Action)

1. ✓ Blueprint passes Physics Check (Lift ≥ Weight)
2. ✓ For each ship: Pay Production Cost + Lifting Gas
3. ✓ For each ship: Spend 1 Pilot token from Barracks to shared supply
4. ✓ Place built ships in your Hangar Bay (up to 3 per action)

## Launch Checklist (Launchpad Action)

1. ✓ Assign each ship in Hangar Bay to a valid route (must meet requirements)
2. ✓ If Luxury Route: Verify ship has Luxury stat requirement met
3. ✓ For each ship, draw Hazard Card from your personal Hazard Deck
4. ✓ (Optional) Play cards from hand to add their Ops to Hazard Check total
5. ✓ (Optional) Spend Engineers reactively to prevent crash if Hazard Card allows
6. ✓ If passed: Place ship on route, increase Income
7. ✓ If failed on Luxury Launch with Hydrogen in Age III: Hindenburg Disaster triggered
8. ✓ If failed otherwise: Return ship to supply, lose Pilot (costs already paid at build)

## Key Formulas

- **Physics Check:** Total Lift ≥ Total Weight
- **Hazard Check:** Ship Stat + Ops + Engineers spent (if allowed by Hazard Card) ≥ Hazard Difficulty
- **Research per Round:** Engineers in Barracks + card bonuses + Research purchased at Research Institute
- **Engineer Upkeep:** £1 per Engineer in Barracks
- **Tech Cost:** Listed cost − Specialization Discount
- **Transition Income:** (£ from Tech tiles) − (£1 × routes lost), minimum £0
- **Victory:** Most Victory Points wins (tiebreakers: Income, Cash, Ships on map)

## Game End Conditions

1. **Hindenburg Disaster:** Failed Luxury Launch + Hydrogen + Age III
2. **Fixed-Wing Rise:** Progress Track reaches threshold

## Scoring Summary (at end of each Age)

**Route VP (2/3 of total):**
| Route | Age I | Age II | Age III |
|-------|-------|--------|---------|
| Short (Range 1-2) | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| Medium (Range 3-4) | 4 | 5 | 7 |
| Long (Range 5-6) | — | 7 | 10 |
| Luxury Bonus | — | — | +3 |

**Technology VP (1/3 of total):** Score VP printed on each Technology tile you own (scored every Age). Essential techs = 0 VP, Useful techs = 1 VP, Niche techs = 2-3 VP

## Age Transition Income

> **New Income = (£ from Tech tiles) − (£1 × routes lost)**

Minimum £0. Technologies cushion the transition; routes cost £1 each when wiped.
