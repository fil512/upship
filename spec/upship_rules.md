# 1. OVERVIEW

Players act as Directors of rival Airship Conglomerates representing the great powers of the early 20th century: **Germany**, **Britain**, **the United States**, and **Italy**. Over three historical Ages, you must research technology, design airship blueprints, and launch fleets to claim routes on an evolving map.

**Victory Condition:** The player with the most **Victory Points** at the end of Age III wins.

**Game End Triggers:** The game ends immediately when ANY of the following occur:

1. **The Hindenburg Disaster:** A Catastrophic Explosion destroys a ship during a Luxury Launch in Age III. The burning wreckage signals the end of public confidence in airship travel. Complete the current round, then proceed to final scoring.

2. **The Rise of Fixed-Wing Aircraft:** The Progress Track reaches its threshold (see Section 1.3). Heavier-than-air craft have become viable competitors, rendering airships obsolete. Complete the current round, then proceed to final scoring.

**Tiebreakers:** If players are tied for Victory Points, apply the following in order until the tie is broken:
1. Highest Income Track position
2. Most Cash on hand
3. Most ships currently on the map

### 1.1 Thematic Pillars

- **Engineering Reality:** The physics of Lift vs. Weight determines what you can fly
- **Industrial Management:** You run a factory, not just one ship—your Blueprint represents your current manufacturing capability
- **Historical Narrative:** Progress through the Pioneer Era, the Great War, and the Golden Age of luxury liners
- **Risk Management:** Every launch is a test of your engineering against the elements

### 1.2 Core Inspirations

The game draws mechanics from:
- **Eclipse:** Tech tracks with specialization discounts, separate technologies and upgrades, blueprint customization
- **Dune: Imperium:** Deck building, worker placement, and end-of-round contests
- **Brass: Lancashire:** Age-based route obsolescence, loan economy, and network building
- **Ticket to Ride:** Route claiming and network expansion

### 1.3 The Progress Track (Fixed-Wing Competition)

A shared track on the board represents the advancement of heavier-than-air aviation. Each time any player acquires a Technology Tile, advance the Progress marker by 1 space. The Progress Track serves two purposes: triggering Age transitions and determining game end.

| Player Count | Age I Ends | Age II Ends | Game Ends |
|--------------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| 2 Players    | 8          | 16          | 20        |
| 3 Players    | 10         | 20          | 25        |
| 4 Players    | 12         | 24          | 30        |

When the marker reaches or exceeds an Age threshold, that Age ends after the current round (see Section 9 for Age Transition procedures). When the marker reaches or exceeds the Game End threshold, the game ends after the current round.

**Thematic Note:** Every breakthrough in aviation technology—whether for airships or not—brings fixed-wing aircraft closer to commercial viability. Your innovations hasten your own obsolescence. The more aggressively players pursue technology, the faster the Ages advance.

### 1.4 Player Count Scaling

The game adjusts for different player counts:

| Component | 2 Players | 3 Players | 4 Players |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Map routes | Use 2P markers | Standard | Standard |

**2-Player Rules:** Some single-track routes are marked "3-4P only" and are unavailable in 2-player games. This maintains competition over limited routes.

# 3. THE PLAYER BOARD (The Factory Interface)

Your Player Board represents your corporation's infrastructure. It is divided into four zones:

## 3.1 Zone 1: The Drawing Office (Left Side)

Your personal Technology display. When you acquire Technologies from the R&D Board, place them here organized by track (Propulsion, Structure, Gas Systems, Payload).

**Technology Tracks:** Your Drawing Office has four horizontal tracks:
- **Propulsion Track:** Engine and drive technologies
- **Structure Track:** Frame, hull, and safety systems
- **Gas Systems Track:** Lifting gas and fuel technologies
- **Payload Track:** Passenger, cargo, and mission equipment

**Specialization Discount:** The more Technologies you have in a single track, the cheaper subsequent Technologies in that track become:

| Technologies in Track | Research Discount |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| 1-2 | None |
| 3-4 | -1 Research |
| 5+ | -2 Research |

**Key Point:** Technologies never expire. You can use an old "Daimler Engine" technology into Age III, but its poor weight-to-power ratio will make the resulting upgrades inefficient for longer routes.

## 3.2 Zone 2: The Blueprint (Center)

An Age-specific overlay representing your current Airship Model—your "Factory Standard."

### Age-Specific Blueprints

Each Age, you replace your Blueprint overlay with the new Age's version. Blueprints have **four slot types** for installing upgrade tiles:

- **Frame Slots:** Accept Frame tiles (structural skeleton). Each Frame slot shows a **gas cube icon** indicating the gas cost for launching.
- **Fabric Slots:** Accept Fabric tiles (outer covering and gas cell materials)
- **Drive Slots:** Accept Propulsion tiles (engines and propellers)
- **Payload Slots:** Accept Payload tiles (cargo, passengers, equipment)

**Age I Blueprint (Pioneer Era):**
- Open Slots: 1 Frame, 1 Fabric, 1 Drive, 1 Payload
- Printed Baseline: Primitive Engine (Speed 1, Range 1)
- Baseline Stats: Speed 1, Range 1, Ceiling 0, Reliability 0
- *Note: One Frame slot = one gas cube required to launch*

**Age II Blueprint (Great War):**
- Open Slots: 1 Frame, 1 Fabric, 2 Drive, 2 Payload
- Printed Baseline: Military Engine (Speed 2, Range 2)
- Baseline Stats: Speed 2, Range 2, Ceiling 1, Reliability 1

**Age III Blueprint (Golden Age):**
- Open Slots: 2 Frame, 2 Fabric, 2 Drive, 3 Payload
- Printed Baseline: Modern Engine (Speed 3, Range 3)
- Baseline Stats: Speed 3, Range 3, Ceiling 2, Reliability 2
- *Note: Two Frame slots = two gas cubes required to launch*

**Required Slots:** You must fill all Frame and Fabric slots before launching. Empty structural slots mean the ship isn't airworthy.

**Historical Blueprint Designs:** Each Blueprint overlay has a distinctive silhouette reflecting the actual airship designs of that era:
- **Age I:** Small, cigar-shaped designs with minimal structure (non-rigid or semi-rigid designs)
- **Age II:** Longer, more refined shapes with visible frame structure (transitional rigid designs)
- **Age III:** Massive streamlined forms with pronounced passenger gondolas (fully rigid giants)

Additionally, each faction's Blueprint boards reflect their historical design philosophy:
- **Germany:** Rigid frame Zeppelin configurations with maximum gas cell capacity
- **Britain:** Distinctive R-series designs with passenger comfort emphasis
- **United States:** Military-influenced designs with robust structural elements
- **Italy:** Semi-rigid designs with unique keel structures (Nobile pattern)

### The Physics Check (The Golden Rule)

You cannot launch a ship if its design is physically impossible:

> **Total Lift ≥ Total Weight**

If your Blueprint violates this rule, your ship cannot leave the ground.

### Ship Stats

Ships in your Hangar Bay are generic airship tokens—they don't track individual stats. When you **launch** a ship, it uses your **current Blueprint stats** at that moment. This means you can build ships now, upgrade your Blueprint later, and launch with the improved design. No bookkeeping required. Ships on routes always use your current Blueprint stats.

## 3.3 Zone 3: The Barracks (Bottom)

Storage for your crew tokens earned from the shared supply:

- **Pilots:** Required to launch a ship. When you launch a ship, you spend 1 Pilot token from your Barracks back to the shared supply. Pilots are only returned to your Barracks when:
  1. An Age ends (all ships are removed from the map)
  2. You voluntarily ground one of your ships

- **Engineers:** Multi-purpose specialists that serve two functions:
  1. **Research Generation:** At the end of each round during the Reveal Phase, your available Research to acquire Technologies equals your number of Engineers in your Barracks plus any Research bonuses from cards remaining in your hand
  2. **Emergency Response:** May be spent reactively during Hazard Checks to prevent crashes under certain circumstances (see Section 7)

**The Engineer's Dilemma:** Engineers are expensive to recruit and maintain, but they are essential for acquiring new Technologies. Spending Engineers on emergencies saves ships but reduces your innovation capacity next round.

## 3.4 Zone 4: The Hangar Bay (Adjacent to Barracks)

Your Hangar Bay has two sections for managing your fleet:

### Launch Hangar
Ships ready to fly:
- **Capacity:** Up to 3 ships can wait in your Launch Hangar
- **Building Ships:** When you take the Construction Hall action, built ships are placed here
- **Launching Ships:** When you take the Launchpad action, you may launch ships from here
- **Build Limit:** You may only build ships up to your Launch Hangar capacity

### Repair Hangar
Ships requiring maintenance before flight:
- **Capacity:** No limit (damaged ships accumulate until repaired)
- **Damaged Ships:** When a fire is controlled (by spending Engineers), the ship is saved but damaged. Place it in your Repair Hangar.
- **Repair Cost:** At the Construction Hall, pay **£3 per ship** to move ships from Repair Hangar to Launch Hangar. This can be done in addition to building new ships.
- **Cannot Launch:** Ships in the Repair Hangar cannot be launched until repaired.

**Strategic Value:** Building ships across multiple rounds then launching in sequence lets you claim multiple routes in one action—but you can stop if Hazards turn ugly. You can even upgrade your Blueprint between building and launching!

## 3.5 Zone 5: Gas Reserve (Adjacent to Hangar Bay)

Storage for lifting gas purchased in advance:

- **Hydrogen Tokens:** Standard lifting gas, cheaper but flammable
- **Helium Tokens:** Safe lifting gas, more expensive (requires Helium Handling technology)
- **Usage:** When launching ships from the Launchpad, use stored gas first. Any deficit must be purchased at current market price.
- **Strategic Value:** Buy gas when market prices are low; use stored gas to avoid price spikes or Helium shortages

## 3.6 Zone 6: Economy Tracks (Right Edge)

- **Income Track:** Tracks your current £ earned per round from routes
- **Pilot Income Track:** Tracks free Pilots gained per round (starts at 1)
- **Engineer Income Track:** Tracks free Engineers gained per round (starts at 1)
- **Loan Marker:** Tracks penalties from loans taken

## 3.7 Zone 7: Blueprint Stat Tracks & Lift Calculator (Adjacent to Blueprint)

Your Player Board includes dedicated tracks for monitoring your current Blueprint's statistics. As you install or remove Upgrade tiles, adjust tracking cubes on these tracks to reflect your ship's current capabilities:

- **Weight Track:** Current total weight of all components
- **Speed Track:** Current speed rating
- **Range Track:** Current range rating
- **Ceiling Track:** Current altitude ceiling
- **Reliability Track:** Current reliability rating
- **Luxury Track:** Current luxury rating for passenger comfort

### Lift/Weight Calculator

Your Player Board includes a visual calculator showing how many gas cubes you need to launch:

```
WEIGHT:     [0]--[5]--[10]--[15]--[20]--[25]--[30]
                  ↑
            (your current weight)

GAS NEEDED:  1 cube  |  2 cubes  |  3 cubes  |  4 cubes
            (Lift 5)   (Lift 10)   (Lift 15)   (Lift 20)
```

Each gas cube provides **+5 Lift** (regardless of type). At a glance, see how many cubes your current Blueprint requires to pass the Physics Check (Lift ≥ Weight).

# 4. THE TECHNOLOGY & UPGRADE SYSTEM

The game distinguishes between **Technologies** (knowledge your company has acquired) and **Upgrades** (physical components installed on your Blueprint).

## 4.1 Technologies

Technologies represent patents, expertise, and manufacturing capability. They are acquired from the R&D Board and stored in your Drawing Office.

**Technology Tile Attributes:**
- **Research Cost:** How much Research to acquire
- **Track:** Which Drawing Office track it belongs to (Propulsion/Structure/Gas/Payload)
- **Age:** Minimum Age when this technology becomes available
- **Unlocks:** Which Upgrade tiles this technology allows you to install
- **£ Value:** Income generated during Age Transitions (all tiles have this)
- **VP Value:** Victory Points scored at each Age end (only some tiles have this)

| Age | Typical £ Value | Typical VP Value |
|-----|-----------------|------------------|
| Age I | £1 | 0-1 VP (most are 0) |
| Age II | £1-2 | 0-3 VP (essential techs are 0, niche techs are 2-3) |
| Age III | £2-3 | 0-3 VP (essential techs are 0, niche techs are 2-3) |

### The R&D Board

A shared display where available Technologies are placed. At the start of each round, draw tiles from the Technology Bag to fill empty spaces:

| Age | Tiles Drawn Per Round |
|-----|----------------------|
| Age I | 4 tiles |
| Age II | 5 tiles |
| Age III | 6 tiles |

At game start, the bag contains only Age I tiles. At each Age Transition, new Age tiles are **added** to the bag—tiles from all previous Ages remain, so the pool of available technologies grows throughout the game.

### Acquiring Technologies

During the **Reveal Phase** at the end of each round:
- **Calculate Research Budget:** Your total available Research equals the number of Engineers in your Barracks plus any Research bonuses printed on cards remaining in your hand
- **Spend Research:** You may spend this Research to acquire one or more Technologies from the R&D Board
- **Cost:** Pay Research equal to the tile's cost (minus any specialization discount)
- **Save Research:** Unspent Research tokens carry over to the next round, allowing players to accumulate Research for expensive Technologies
- **Result:** Add acquired tiles to the appropriate track in your Drawing Office
- **Progress:** Advance the Progress Track by 1 for each Technology acquired

**Note:** Only Technologies acquired from the R&D Board advance the Progress Track. Faction starting Technologies (pre-printed on Player Boards) do not count toward Progress.

**Example:** You have 3 Engineers in your Barracks and reveal 2 cards with Research bonuses (+1 and +2). Your total Research budget is 6. You could acquire a 4-cost Technology and a 2-cost Technology, or a single 6-cost Technology (assuming no specialization discounts).

## 4.2 Upgrades

Upgrades are the physical components you install on your Blueprint. Each Upgrade tile type has a corresponding Technology that must be in your Drawing Office before you can install it.

**Upgrade Tile Attributes:**
- **Weight:** How much Lift is consumed (negative number)
- **Stats:** Bonuses to Speed, Range, Ceiling, Reliability, or Income
- **Special Effects:** Unique abilities (e.g., "Flammable," "Safe," "Luxury")
- **Required Tech:** Which Technology tile you must own to install this

### The Upgrade Supply

A shared supply of Upgrade tiles organized by type. Unlike Technologies, Upgrades are not limited—if you have the required Technology, you can always install the corresponding Upgrade (unless physically out of components).

### Installing Upgrades (The Upgrade Action)

Visit **The Design Bureau** on the Ground Board:
- **Action:** Modify your Blueprint
- **Cost:** Free (but limited swaps per action)
- **Swaps Allowed:** 2 tile installations or removals per action (cards and abilities can increase this)
- **Constraint:** You may only install Upgrades for which you own the corresponding Technology

**Examples of Upgrade Actions:**
- Install 2 new tiles (2 swaps, the base action)
- Remove 1 tile and install 2 new tiles (3 swaps, requires a card bonus)
- Install 4 new tiles (4 swaps, requires Italy's Rapid Refit or multiple card bonuses)

**Removed Tiles:** When you remove an Upgrade from your Blueprint, return it to the shared Upgrade Supply. You retain the Technology and can reinstall the same Upgrade type later.

## 4.3 Technology → Upgrade Examples

| Technology (Drawing Office) | Unlocks Upgrade (Blueprint) |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Maybach Engine Design | Maybach CX Engine: Speed +2, Range +1, Weight -2 |
| Helium Handling | Helium Gas Cell: Safe, Weight -1 (enables Helium cubes) |
| Passenger Gondola | Luxury Cabin: Income +3, Luxury +2, Weight -3 |
| Duralumin Framework | Rigid Frame: Reliability +2, Ceiling +1, Weight -2 |

## 4.4 Lifting Gas: The Critical Resource

Historically, helium was so scarce that the first American airship to use it (USS Shenandoah) contained most of the world's supply. This scarcity is reflected in the game.

### Gas Cubes and Lift

Each gas cube provides **+5 Lift**, regardless of gas type. The number of gas cubes needed depends on your Blueprint's total Weight (see the Lift/Weight Calculator on your Player Board).

**Gas Selection:** When launching a ship, you choose which gas type to use. This choice is made independently for each launch—it's purely a cost vs. risk calculation.

**No Mixing Rule:** A single launch must use all one gas type. You cannot mix Hydrogen and Helium cubes on the same launch.

**Gas Cubes Consumed:** When you launch, spend gas cubes from your Gas Reserve. If your reserve is insufficient, purchase additional cubes at current market prices. Spent cubes return to the general supply.

### Gas Pricing

| Gas Type | Price | Lift | Fire Risk |
|----------|-------|------|-----------|
| **Hydrogen** | £1/cube (fixed) | +5 | Vulnerable to Fire hazards |
| **Helium** | £2-15/cube (market) | +5 | Immune to Fire hazards |

**Hydrogen** is cheap and readily available, but ships using it are vulnerable to Fire-type Hazard cards and the Hindenburg Disaster.

**Helium** requires the *Helium Handling* Technology and uses a **market track** pricing system:
- **Starting Price:** £2 per cube
- **Market Advancement:** When a non-USA player purchases Helium at the Gas Depot, advance the Helium Market Track by 1 step per cube. Prices increase as the track advances: £2 → £3 → £4 → £5 → £6 → £8 → £10 → £15 (8 steps total).
- **Market Maximum:** When the track reaches £15, Helium remains available at £15 per cube. The track cannot advance beyond this point.
- **Market Reduction:** The Ministry action reduces the Helium Market Track by 1 step (minimum £2)—political lobbying releases government reserves.
- **USA Exception:** The United States has domestic Helium production. When USA purchases Helium, the Market Track does NOT advance (they draw from their own supply, not the global market).
- **Age Reset:** The Helium Market Track resets to £2 at each Age Transition (new sources discovered).

### Gas Storage (Gas Reserve)

Players store gas cubes on their Player Board in the **Gas Reserve** area. You purchase gas at the Gas Depot action space, then spend it when launching ships. Having gas in reserve lets you avoid market spikes.

**The Strategic Choice:** Hydrogen is cheap but dangerous. Helium is safe but expensive (and gets more expensive as others buy it). Choose your risk tolerance each launch.

# 5. THE MAPS

The game features three physical map boards, one for each Age. When an Age ends, the map is replaced, all ships on it are removed, and players lose the Income from those routes.

## 5.1 Age I: The Cradle (Western Europe)

**Scale:** Regional (zoomed in)
**Geography:** Southern England, Northern France, Western Germany (The Rhineland)
**Theme:** Picturesque but dangerous. You are flying low over rivers because your engines are weak.

**Route Characteristics:**
- Short, winding river routes
- Low stat requirements
- Focus on **Reliability** (can you fly 100km without your engine seizing up?)

**Placement Rule:** No home bases. Players can launch to *any* unclaimed route on the map (the Pioneer Scramble). If multiple players attempt to claim the same single-track route in the same round, resolve by turn order (lowest Income goes first—see Section 6.1).

## 5.2 Age II: The Great War (Greater Europe)

**Scale:** Continental (mid-zoom)
**Geography:** Extends to Scapa Flow (Scotland), the Russian Front (Warsaw), and the Mediterranean
**Theme:** Hostile and industrial. The war has transformed civilian aviation.

**Route Characteristics:**
- Direct routes requiring high altitude
- "War Zone" routes requiring Armor
- Government contracts provide lump sum bonuses

**Placement Rule:** Players **must** launch their first ship of this Age from their **Home Base** (Germany: Friedrichshafen, Britain: Cardington, USA: Paimboeuf, Italy: Rome). Subsequent ships must connect to your existing network.

## 5.3 Age III: The Golden Age (The Atlantic)

**Scale:** Hemispheric (zoomed out)
**Geography:** North Atlantic, US East Coast, Brazil, Europe, routes to India
**Theme:** Majestic luxury liners spanning oceans.

**Route Characteristics:**
- Massive ocean crossings (Distance 4, 5, or 6)
- Focus on **Range** and **Luxury**
- Competition for the "Blue Riband" (fastest Atlantic crossing)
- **Luxury Routes:** Some routes require the Luxury stat and trigger Luxury Launch rules

**Placement Rule:** Players can launch from **any Major Metropolis** (New York, London, Berlin, Rio), regardless of nationality.

## 5.4 Route Requirements

Routes do not use simple color-coding. Instead, each route has **Minimum Stats** printed on the map:

| Example Route | Requirements |
|---------------|--------------|
| Hamburg → Berlin | Range 1 |
| London → Paris | Speed 2, Range 1 |
| London → New York | Range 5, Ceiling 3 |
| New York → Rio (Luxury) | Range 4, Luxury 2 |

Your Blueprint stats must meet or exceed **all** listed requirements to claim a route.

## 5.5 Route Capacity

- **Single Track:** Only 1 player can claim (first come, first served)
- **Double Track:** Up to 2 players can claim the same connection
- Routes are exclusive monopolies until the Age ends or your ship crashes

Since players take turns, route claims are resolved in turn order—no simultaneous claims occur.

## 5.6 Route Income Values

When you claim a route, increase your Income Track by the route's Income value. Income values are printed on each route and follow this formula:

> **Route Income = Range requirement + Age bonus + Luxury bonus**

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Range requirement | £1 per Range point |
| Age II bonus | +£1 |
| Age III bonus | +£2 |
| Luxury route bonus | +£2 |

**Example Routes:**

| Route | Range | Age | Luxury | Income |
|-------|-------|-----|--------|--------|
| Hamburg → Berlin | 1 | I | No | £1 |
| London → Paris | 2 | I | No | £2 |
| Berlin → Moscow | 3 | II | No | £4 |
| London → New York | 5 | III | Yes | £9 |
| New York → Rio | 4 | III | Yes | £8 |

**Design Target:** Ships should pay for themselves within 3-5 rounds of operation.

## 5.7 City Bonuses

When you successfully claim a route, in addition to increasing your Income Track, you gain a **one-time bonus** from one of the route's endpoint cities (your choice).

### Age I Cities (Western Europe)

| City | Bonus | Thematic Reason |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| **London** | +£3 | Financial capital |
| **Paris** | +1 Influence | Cultural prestige |
| **Berlin** | +1 Research | Engineering hub |
| **Frankfurt** | +£2 | Banking center |
| **Hamburg** | +1 Gas cube (Hydrogen) | Industrial port |
| **Brussels** | +1 Pilot | Aviation pioneers |

### Age II Cities (Greater Europe)

| City | Bonus | Thematic Reason |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| **Friedrichshafen** | +1 Research | Zeppelin headquarters |
| **Cardington** | +1 Engineer | British R&D base |
| **Rome** | +1 Influence | Political center |
| **Moscow** | +£4 | Government contracts |
| **Cairo** | Free Upgrade swap | Colonial logistics |
| **Scapa Flow** | +1 Pilot | Naval aviation |

### Age III Cities (The Atlantic)

| City | Bonus | Thematic Reason |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| **New York** | +£5 | Commercial capital |
| **Lakehurst** | +1 Engineer | US airship base |
| **Rio de Janeiro** | +2 Influence | Prestige destination |
| **Recife** | +1 Gas cube (any type) | Refueling stop |
| **Seville** | Draw 1 card | Trade connections |
| **Bombay** | +£3, +1 Influence | Imperial trade |

**Strategic Note:** When claiming a route, consider which endpoint offers the bonus you need most. City bonuses scale with Age—Age III cities offer the most valuable rewards.

---

# 6. THE GAME LOOP

The game is played in **Rounds**. Each round follows this structure:

## 6.1 Phase A: Worker Placement (Ground Operations)

Players take turns placing **one Agent** at a time until all players pass. To place an Agent, you must play a **Card** from your hand that matches the location's icon.

### Turn Order

At the start of each round, determine turn order based on **Income Track position** (lowest goes first). This creates a catch-up mechanism: struggling players get first choice of actions.

**Ties:** If players are tied on Income, the player with less Cash goes first. If still tied, the player closest clockwise to the start player goes first.

**First Round:** Determine first player randomly.

### Ground Board Locations:

The Ground Board has 12 action spaces, each marked with one of three symbols. To visit a space, you must play a card showing that symbol.

**Symbol Types:**
- **Wrench (Technical):** Engineering and construction activities
- **Coin (Business):** Financial and personnel activities
- **Propeller (Operations):** Research and flight activities
- **Any:** Some cards show "Any" as their symbol—these can be used to visit ANY action space

---

**1. The Research Institute (Propeller)**
- **Action:** Purchase Research with money
- **Cost:** £3 per Research point (card Agent Effects may reduce this cost)
- **Effect:** Gain Research tokens that can be spent this round during Technology acquisition in the Reveal Phase
- **Strategic Note:** This provides an alternate path for cash-rich, engineer-poor players to acquire Technologies

**2. The Design Bureau (Wrench)**
- **Action:** Modify your Blueprint (install/remove Upgrades)
- **Cost:** Free
- **Limit:** 2 tile swaps per action (cards and abilities can increase this)
- **Constraint:** Can only install Upgrades for Technologies you own

**3. The Construction Hall (Wrench)**
- **Action:** Build ships
- **Cost:** Hull Cost per ship (£ based on Frame + Fabric upgrades installed)
- **Limit:** Build up to 3 ships per action
- **Cost Reduction:** Card effects and faction abilities can reduce Hull Cost
- **Effect:** Pay £ costs. Built ships are placed in your **Hangar Bay**, waiting to be launched.
- **Hull Upgrade Rule:** If you upgrade your Frame or Fabric while ships are in your Launch Hangar, pay the Hull Cost difference for each ship already built. If you downgrade (remove or replace with cheaper tiles), you do not receive a refund

**4. The Launchpad (Propeller)**
- **Action:** Launch ships from your Launch Hangar
- **Requirement:** Blueprint must pass Physics Check (Total Lift ≥ Total Weight) AND all Frame/Fabric slots must be filled
- **Cost per Launch:** 1 Pilot + Lifting Gas (from Gas Reserve first; deficit at market price)
- **Effect:** You may launch as many ships from your Launch Hangar as you wish, one after another. Each launch is resolved separately:
  1. Verify Physics Check passes and all structural slots are filled
  2. Spend 1 Pilot and pay for gas (choose Hydrogen or Helium, no mixing)
  3. Choose a ship and assign it to a valid route
  4. Resolve Hazard Check (draw one Hazard Card)
  5. If successful: Place ship on route, increase Income Track, gain city bonus
  6. Repeat for additional ships, or stop at any time
- **Result:** You control pacing—stop after a bad Hazard draw, or press your luck
- **Strategic Note:** Building is cheap; launching is the commitment. Build ships early, upgrade your Blueprint, then launch when ready

**5. The Academy (Coin)**
- **Action:** Recruit crew from the shared supply
- **Cost:** £2 per Pilot, £4 per Engineer
- **Result:** Gain Pilot or Engineer tokens from the shared supply to your Barracks
- **Market Purge:** You may also discard the leftmost card from the Market Row (removing unwanted cards from circulation)
- **Note:** Pilots are cheaper because they are consumed when launching ships; Engineers persist and generate ongoing Research

**6. The Flight School (Coin)**
- **Action:** Expand your pilot training program
- **Cost:** £5 per level
- **Effect:** Increase your Pilot Income track by 1 step
- **Strategic Note:** Investing in Pilot Income provides a steady stream of free Pilots each round, reducing reliance on the Academy

**7. The Technical Institute (Wrench)**
- **Action:** Expand your engineering program
- **Cost:** £6 per level
- **Effect:** Increase your Engineer Income track by 1 step
- **Strategic Note:** Investing in Engineer Income provides free Engineers each round, fueling your Research capacity without ongoing recruitment costs

**8. The Bank (Coin)**
- **Action:** Take a loan
- **Effect:** Gain £30 immediately
- **Penalty:** Immediately reduce your Income Track marker by 3 positions (this is a permanent reduction to your ongoing income)

**9. The Ministry (Propeller)**
- **Action:** Political maneuvering
- **Cost:** Free
- **Effect:** Draw 2 cards from your deck and discard 1. Additionally, you go first in turn order next round (regardless of Income Track position). Finally, reduce the Helium Market Track by 1 step (minimum £2)—your lobbying pressures governments to release strategic reserves.
- **Multiple Visitors:** If multiple players visit the Ministry in the same round, the player who visited first goes first next round, followed by other Ministry visitors in the order they visited, then remaining players by Income Track.
- **Strategic Note:** The Ministry gives you card selection, priority, AND lowers Helium prices. Even if you don't use Helium yourself, lowering prices helps all non-USA players—or you can time your visit to buy cheap Helium next round.

**10. The Gas Depot (Wrench)**
- **Action:** Purchase lifting gas for storage
- **Hydrogen Price:** £1 per cube (fixed price)
- **Helium Price:** Current market track price (starts at £2, increases as supply depletes)
- **Effect:** Add gas cubes to your Gas Reserve on your Player Board. When purchasing Helium, advance the Helium Market Track by 1 for each cube purchased (increasing the price for future purchases).
- **USA Special:** The United States may purchase Helium without advancing the Market Track (representing their domestic supply). Other factions must purchase from the limited global supply.
- **Strategic Note:** Buy gas when prices are low; stored gas can be used later when launching ships, avoiding market price spikes. Americans have guaranteed Helium access at stable prices.

**11. The Insurance Bureau (Coin)**
- **Action:** Purchase insurance policies
- **Cost:** Reduce your Income Track by 1 step per policy (representing ongoing premiums)
- **Effect:** Take policy cards and place them face-up near your Player Board. You may purchase up to 3 policies total (not per visit).
- **Policy Benefit:** When one of your ships **crashes** (destroyed by fire or catastrophic hazard), you may discard one policy card to recover the airship token to your Launch Hangar instead of losing it. You still lose the Pilot and any gas spent, but you keep the ship for another attempt.
- **Note:** Insurance only applies to crashes (ship destruction), NOT aborted launches from failed Hazard Checks.
- **Strategic Note:** Insurance protects against catastrophic losses but reduces your income permanently. The more policies you hold, the safer you are—but the poorer you become.

**12. The Weather Bureau (Propeller)**
- **Action:** Consult weather forecasts
- **Cost:** £2
- **Effect:** Peek at the top card of your personal Hazard Deck—this is the hazard you'll face on your NEXT launch. You may either leave it on top or discard it to your Hazard discard pile.
- **Strategic Note:** Preview what's coming. If you see a dangerous hazard, discard it now. If you see Clear Skies, plan a launch!

## 6.2 Phase B: Reveal & Acquisition

After all players pass, the round enters the Reveal Phase:

### Step 1: Reveal Hands
All players simultaneously reveal the cards remaining in their hands (cards not used for worker placement).

### Step 2: Gain Resources from Reveal Icons
Collect resources shown on your revealed cards:
- **£ (Money):** Gain cash immediately
- **Research:** Add to your Research pool for acquiring Technologies (in addition to Engineers in your Barracks)
- **Pilot:** Gain Pilot tokens to your Barracks
- **Engineer:** Gain Engineer tokens to your Barracks
- **Gas:** Gain gas tokens to your Gas Reserve
- **Influence:** Save for purchasing cards in Step 4

### Step 3: Acquire Technologies
Players may spend their Research budget to acquire one or more Technologies from the R&D Board:
- Pay Research equal to each tile's cost (minus any specialization discount)
- Add acquired tiles to the appropriate track in your Drawing Office
- Advance the Progress Track by 1 for each Technology acquired
- Unspent Research tokens are saved for future rounds

### Step 4: Purchase Cards
Players may spend Influence to buy cards from the Market Row. Purchased cards go to your discard pile. Unspent Influence is lost at the end of the round (unlike Research, Influence cannot be saved).

## 6.3 Phase C: Income & Cleanup

1. **Pay Engineer Upkeep:** Deduct £1 per Engineer in your Barracks from your income
2. **Collect Income:** Each player gains £ equal to their Income Track position (minus Engineer upkeep)
3. **Collect Crew Income:** Each player gains Pilots equal to their Pilot Income Track, and Engineers equal to their Engineer Income Track
4. **Refresh R&D Board:** Draw new Technology tiles from the bag to fill empty R&D Board spaces
5. **Check Age Transition:** If the Progress Track has reached or exceeded the current Age threshold, trigger Age Transition (see Section 9)
6. **Refresh Agents:** Return all Agents to player supplies
7. **Draw Cards:** Shuffle discard pile into deck if needed; draw cards until you have at least 5 cards in hand (if you already have 5 or more, do not draw)
8. **Refill Market Row:** Add new cards to the right side of the Market Row until there are 5 cards. When cards are purchased, remaining cards slide left (oldest cards on left, newest on right).

---

# 7. BUILDING AND LAUNCHING SHIPS

Ships are constructed at the Construction Hall and launched from the Launchpad. This two-step process lets you build multiple ships and launch them together.

## 7.1 The Build Procedure (Construction Hall Action)

When you take the **Construction Hall Action**, you construct ships:

1. **Pay Hull Cost:** For each ship you build, pay the Hull Cost in £
2. **Place in Hangar Bay:** Built ships are placed in your Hangar Bay, waiting for launch

### Hull Cost Formula

> **Hull Cost = £2 base + Frame tile cost + Fabric tile cost**

Each Frame and Fabric upgrade tile shows a **Hull Cost modifier** (£0 to £3). Add all installed Frame and Fabric tile costs to the £2 base.

**Example Hull Costs:**
| Configuration | Calculation | Total |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| No upgrades (baseline) | £2 base | £2 |
| Wooden Frame + Cotton Envelope | £2 + £1 + £0 | £3 |
| Duralumin Frame + Doped Covering | £2 + £2 + £1 | £5 |
| Geodetic Frame + Premium Envelope | £2 + £3 + £3 | £8 |

**Cost Reduction:** Card effects and faction abilities can reduce Hull Cost (minimum £0).

**Hull Upgrade Rule:** If you upgrade your Frame or Fabric while ships are in your Launch Hangar, you must pay the difference in Hull Cost for each ship already built. This represents retrofitting the improved materials. If you downgrade (remove or replace with cheaper tiles), you do not receive a refund. Ships in the Repair Hangar are not affected (they will use the new Blueprint when repaired and launched).

**Build Limit:** You may build up to 3 ships per Construction Hall action.

**Note:** Physics Check is NOT required to build—only to launch. You can build ships for a Blueprint that doesn't fly yet, then add gas cubes and Lift upgrades before launching.

## 7.2 The Launch Procedure (Launchpad Action)

When you take the **Launchpad Action**, you may launch as many ships from your Launch Hangar as you wish, one after another. Each launch is resolved separately:

1. **Verify Requirements:**
   - Physics Check must pass (Total Lift ≥ Total Weight)
   - All Frame and Fabric slots must be filled
2. **Select a Ship:** Choose one ship from your Launch Hangar
3. **Pay Launch Costs:**
   - Spend 1 Pilot from your Barracks (returned to shared supply)
   - Choose gas type (Hydrogen or Helium—no mixing)
   - Pay for Lifting Gas (use Gas Reserve first; any deficit at current market price)
4. **Assign Route:** Declare which route this ship will attempt (must meet route's stat requirements)
5. **Resolve Hazard Check:** Draw a Hazard Card and resolve it (see 7.3)
6. **Outcome:**
   - **Success:** Place ship on route; increase your Income Track; gain city bonus from one endpoint
   - **Aborted:** Ship returns to your Launch Hangar (Pilot and gas lost)
   - **Damaged:** Ship goes to Repair Hangar (Pilot and gas lost)
   - **Crash:** Ship destroyed, returns to shared supply (Pilot and gas lost)
7. **Continue or Stop:** After resolving each ship, you may launch another ship or stop

**Strategic Timing:** Building is cheap; launching is the commitment. You can stockpile ships in your Hangar, then upgrade your Blueprint to pass the Physics Check before launching.

## 7.3 Resolving Hazard Checks

Each Hazard Card shows a **Challenge Type** and **Difficulty Rating**:
- *Example:* "Strong Headwind — Requires Speed 3"
- *Example:* "Icing Conditions — Requires Ceiling 2"
- *Example:* "Clear Skies — Auto Pass"

**Check Your Ship Stat:**
> Compare your Blueprint's relevant stat to the Hazard Difficulty

**Reactive Engineer Spending:** After seeing the Hazard Card, you may spend Engineer tokens from your Barracks to boost your check. Each Engineer spent adds +1 to your total. Engineers spent now won't generate Research during the Reveal Phase.

**Outcome:**
- **Pass:** If your ship stat (+ Engineers spent) meets or exceeds the Difficulty, the ship is successfully launched. Place it on the route and increase your Income Track.
- **Fail:** If your total is less than the Difficulty, the launch fails. The ship returns to your Hangar Bay, but you lose the Pilot and gas already spent.

**Hazard Card Discard:** After resolving a Hazard Check, place the drawn card face-up in your Hazard discard pile. When your Hazard deck is empty and you need to draw, shuffle your discard pile to form a new deck.

## 7.4 Fire Hazards (Hydrogen Ships)

Ships using **Hydrogen** are vulnerable to fire. The Hazard Deck contains Fire-type hazard cards that only affect Hydrogen ships:

### Fire Hazard Cards

| Card | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Engine Fire** | Spend 1 Engineer to control. Success: Ship is **Damaged** (→ Repair Hangar). Failure: Ship **crashes**, Pilot lost. |
| **Gas Cell Rupture** | Spend 2 Engineers to control. Success: Ship is **Damaged** (→ Repair Hangar). Failure: Ship **crashes**, Pilot lost. |
| **Catastrophic Explosion** | No save possible. Ship **crashes**, Pilot lost. If this occurs during a Luxury Launch in Age III: triggers the **Hindenburg Disaster** game end. |

### Fire Immunity

Ships using **Helium Gas Cells** (from the Helium Handling technology) automatically pass all Fire-type hazards. Helium is non-flammable.

### Damaged Ships

When a fire is controlled (by spending the required Engineers), the ship survives but is damaged:
- Place the ship in your **Repair Hangar** (not on the route)
- The Pilot survives but returns to the shared supply
- Gas cubes are still spent
- You do NOT gain Income or a city bonus from this launch

**The Hydrogen Gamble:** Hydrogen is cheap but every launch risks fire. Helium is expensive but eliminates fire risk completely. This is the core strategic choice.

## 7.5 Luxury Launches (Age III)

Routes marked as **Luxury Routes** require ships with the Luxury stat and trigger special rules:

**Luxury Launch Requirements:**
- Your Blueprint must have at least one Payload upgrade with the **Luxury** trait
- The route must show a Luxury requirement you can meet

**The Hindenburg Risk:** If you draw a **Catastrophic Explosion** fire hazard during a Luxury Launch in Age III using Hydrogen, the game immediately triggers the **Hindenburg Disaster** end condition.

**Thematic Note:** A luxury liner full of passengers catching fire over a crowded landing field is a catastrophe that ends public trust in airship travel forever.

**Safe Alternative:** Ships using **Helium Gas Cells** (from the Helium Handling technology) automatically pass Fire-type hazards and cannot trigger the Hindenburg Disaster.

---

# 8. THE DECK-BUILDING SYSTEM

Every card in the game has **dual functionality**, creating constant tension between using cards for actions versus saving them for the reveal phase.

## 8.1 Card Anatomy

| Section | Location | Function |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Action Symbol** | Top Left | One of three symbols (Wrench/Coin/Propeller) determining which action spaces you can visit |
| **Agent Effect** | Middle | Bonus when using this card for worker placement |
| **Reveal Icons** | Bottom | Resource icons generated when card is revealed at end of round |

**The Three Action Symbols:**
- **Wrench (Technical):** Design Bureau, Construction Hall, Technical Institute, Gas Depot
- **Coin (Business):** Academy, Flight School, Bank, Insurance Bureau
- **Propeller (Operations):** Research Institute, Launchpad, Ministry, Weather Bureau

**Reveal Resource Icons:**
- **£ (Money):** Gain this much cash immediately
- **Research:** Add to your Research pool for acquiring Technologies
- **Pilot:** Gain a Pilot token to your Barracks
- **Engineer:** Gain an Engineer token to your Barracks
- **Gas:** Gain a gas token to your Gas Reserve
- **Influence:** Spend to purchase cards from the Market Row

## 8.2 The Core Decision

When you draw a card, you must decide:
- **Use it for Worker Placement:** Send an Agent to a matching location (same symbol), trigger the Agent Effect, but the card is discarded (no reveal benefit)
- **Save it for Reveal:** Keep it in hand until end of round to generate resources from Reveal Icons

**Symbol Tension:** To build ships AND launch them in the same round, you need both Wrench cards (for Construction Hall) and Propeller cards (for Launchpad). Managing your hand's symbol mix is critical.

## 8.3 Starter Deck (10 Cards)

Every player begins with these basic cards representing primitive but essential capabilities:

| Card | Qty | Symbol | Agent Effect | Reveal |
|------|-----|--------|--------------|--------|
| **Apprentice** | 2 | Any | None | 1 Influence |
| **Mechanic** | 2 | Wrench | +1 tile swap this action | 1 £ |
| **Draftsman** | 2 | Wrench | Draw 1 card | 1 Influence |
| **Researcher** | 2 | Propeller | -£1 per Research at Research Institute | 1 Research |
| **Purser** | 1 | Coin | Gain £2 | 2 Influence |
| **Helmsman** | 1 | Propeller | +1 to any ship stat for this launch | 1 Pilot |

## 8.4 Market Deck Categories

The Market Row offers more powerful cards in several categories:

**Technical Support**
- Cards that help with building, upgrades, and engineering
- Example: *Chief Engineer* — Wrench: +2 tile swaps. Reveal: 1 Engineer

**Political Backing (High Influence)**
- Cards that help purchase expensive cards and gain favor
- Example: *The Aristocrat* — Coin: Gain £5. Reveal: 3 Influence

**Operational Efficiency**
- Cards that reduce costs or provide special abilities
- Example: *Test Pilot* — Propeller: +2 Reliability for this launch. Reveal: 1 Pilot

**Research & Development**
- Cards that accelerate technology acquisition
- Example: *University Partnership* — Propeller: -£2 per Technology this round. Reveal: 2 Research

**Organizations & Institutions**
- Expensive, powerful cards representing major backing
- Example: *Royal Geographic Society* — Wrench: Install an Upgrade ignoring Technology requirements. Reveal: 1 Engineer, 2 Influence

---

# 9. THE AGE TRANSITIONS

## 9.1 Triggering the Transition

Each Age ends when the Progress Track reaches or exceeds the Age threshold (see Section 1.3 for thresholds by player count). The transition is checked during the Income & Cleanup phase, after Technologies are acquired but before Agents are refreshed. When an Age ends:

1. **Scoring:** All players score VP for routes and Technology tiles (see Section 12.7).
2. **Route Wipe:** Remove the current Map. All ships on it are returned to player supplies.
3. **Transition Income:** Calculate your starting Income for the next Age:
   > **New Income = (£ from Technology tiles) − (£1 × number of routes lost)**

   Each Technology tile shows a £ value representing licensing fees and consulting contracts. Each route you lose costs £1 in restructuring. Set your Income Track to this value (minimum £0).

   *Example: You have Technologies worth £5 total and lost 2 routes. Your new Income = £5 − £2 = £3.*

4. **Pilot Recovery:** All Pilots spent on ships return to player Barracks.
5. **Blueprint Transition:** Replace your Blueprint overlay with the new Age's version. You may transfer Upgrade tiles from your old Blueprint to your new Blueprint for free (subject to slot availability and the Physics Check). Upgrades not transferred return to the supply. Technologies are always retained.
6. **Map Setup:** Place the new Age's Map.
7. **Technology Bag Update:** Add the new Age's Technology tiles to the bag.
8. **R&D Board Refresh:** Draw tiles to fill the R&D Board.

## 9.2 The Strategic Challenge

The Age Transition creates a "ticking clock" forcing difficult decisions:
- Do you invest in routes for VP, knowing each one costs £1 at transition?
- Do you acquire Technologies for their £ values to cushion the transition?
- Can you balance short-term route income with long-term Technology investment?
- Your Technologies carry forward, but your Upgrades don't—plan ahead

---

# 10. THE FOUR FACTIONS

Each nation has a unique starting Blueprint configuration, special technology, and distinct playstyle.

## 10.1 Germany (Luftschiffbau Zeppelin)

**Archetype:** The High-Stakes Engineers
**Philosophy:** Technological superiority at any cost. They build the biggest, fastest ships but must use dangerous hydrogen.

**Starting Advantage:** Masters of rigid airship construction. Germany starts with premium structural technologies.

**Starting Technologies (pre-printed on Player Board):**
- *Duralumin Framework* — The lightweight aluminum alloy that made giant Zeppelins possible. Unlocks the Duralumin Frame upgrade.
- *Goldbeater's Skin* — Cattle intestine membrane, the finest gas cell material. Unlocks the Premium Envelope upgrade.
- *Blaugas Fuel System* — A special fuel that weighs the same as air. Unlocks the Blaugas Tank upgrade.

**The Flaw:** *The Helium Embargo* — Germany cannot acquire the Helium Handling technology. They are permanently locked to Hydrogen (Flammable). In Age III, every Luxury Launch risks triggering the Hindenburg Disaster.

**Home Base (Age II):** Friedrichshafen

## 10.2 Britain (Royal Airship Works)

**Archetype:** The Imperial Bureaucrats
**Philosophy:** Connecting the Empire. Their ships are designed for comfort and long-haul sustainability.

**Starting Advantage:** *Pre-Installed Luxury* — Their Age I Blueprint includes a printed Dining Saloon component, generating steady VP/Income from Turn 1 and giving them an early Luxury stat.

**Starting Technologies (pre-printed on Player Board):**
- *Wire Bracing* — Conservative but proven structural approach. Unlocks the Tensioned Frame upgrade.
- *Doped Canvas* — Cellulose-treated cotton for a taut, aerodynamic finish. Unlocks the Doped Covering upgrade.
- *Imperial Mooring System* — Unlocks the Imperial Mast upgrade: Treat any British Territory (Egypt, Canada, India) as a Home Base for repair/refuel, extending effective range.

**The Flaw:** *Red Tape* — When taking the Upgrade Action at the Design Bureau, Britain may only make 1 tile swap instead of 2 (government inefficiency).

**Home Base (Age II):** Cardington

## 10.3 United States (Goodyear-Zeppelin)

**Archetype:** The Military Industrialists
**Philosophy:** Safety and power. They have access to strategic resources Europeans don't.

**Starting Advantage:** *Helium Monopoly* — The only faction that starts with the Helium Handling technology already in their Drawing Office. Their ships can be immune to Fire disaster cards and the Hindenburg Disaster. Additionally, when the USA purchases Helium at the Gas Depot, the Helium Market Track does NOT advance—they draw from domestic reserves rather than the global supply, giving them stable prices while other factions drive costs up.

**Starting Technologies (pre-printed on Player Board):**
- *Duralumin Framework* — Licensed from Germany through the Goodyear-Zeppelin partnership. Unlocks the Duralumin Frame upgrade.
- *Gelatinized Latex* — Goodyear's synthetic innovation that replaced goldbeater's skin. Unlocks the Synthetic Envelope upgrade.
- *Trapeze Fighter System* — Unlocks the Sparrowhawk Hangar upgrade: A hangar for biplanes. When launching to a route, you may ignore one stat requirement (your fighter escorts compensate). Additionally, military routes in Age II provide +2 Income.
- *Helium Handling* — Safe, non-flammable lifting gas. Unlocks the Helium Gas Cell upgrade.

**No Flaw:** The United States' advantages (Helium monopoly, stable prices, fire immunity) are balanced by Helium's higher cost and the USA's late entry into the airship race historically.

**Home Base (Age II):** Paimboeuf, France (American transatlantic operations base)

**Home Base (Age III):** Lakehurst, New Jersey

## 10.4 Italy (Nobile Construction)

**Archetype:** The Agile Explorers
**Philosophy:** Small is beautiful. They build nimble semi-rigid ships designed to dance through storms.

**Starting Advantage:** *Rapid Refit* — When taking the Upgrade Action, Italy may make up to 4 tile swaps instead of 2. They can reconfigure their Blueprint much faster than other nations.

**Starting Technologies (pre-printed on Player Board):**
- *Internal Keel* — The signature semi-rigid design. Unlocks the Semi-Rigid Keel upgrade (lightweight and reliable).
- *Rubberized Cotton* — Simple, proven envelope material. Unlocks the Cotton Envelope upgrade.
- *Articulated Keel Design* — Unlocks the Flexible Frame upgrade: Ignore Weather penalties on Hazard cards. When others are grounded by storms, you can fly.

**The Flaw:** *Low Ceiling* — Semi-rigid frames cannot support heavy payloads. Italy's Blueprint overlays have one fewer Payload slot than other factions. They must win on quantity, not quality.

**Home Base (Age II):** Rome

## 10.5 Faction Blueprint Slot Summary

Each faction's Blueprint has different slot configurations. Slots are listed as Frame/Fabric/Drive/Payload (F/Fb/D/P):

| Faction | Age I Slots | Age II Slots | Age III Slots |
|---------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| Germany | 1/1/1/1 | 1/1/2/2 | 2/2/2/3 |
| Britain | 1/1/1/1 | 1/1/2/2 | 2/2/2/3 |
| USA | 1/1/1/1 | 1/1/2/2 | 2/2/2/3 |
| Italy | 1/1/1/1 | 1/1/2/1 | 2/2/2/2 |

**Note:** Italy's "Low Ceiling" flaw results in fewer Payload slots. Frame slots determine gas cube capacity (and thus Lift potential).

---

# 11. GAME SETUP

## 11.1 Board Setup

1. Place the **Ground Board** in the center of the table
2. Place the **Age I Map** (Western Europe) next to it
3. Place the **R&D Board** and fill it with 4 Technology tiles drawn from the Age I bag
4. Set up the **Upgrade Supply** organized by type
5. Place the **Progress Track** marker at 0
6. Set up the **Pilot and Engineer Token** shared supplies
7. Shuffle the **Market Deck**; deal a row of 5 face-up cards
8. Set up the **Lifting Gas Market Track**

## 11.2 Player Setup

Each player receives:
1. **Player Board** with their faction's layout (including pre-printed starting technology)
2. **Age I Blueprint Overlay** installed
3. **Personal Hazard Deck** of 20 cards (shuffled)
4. **£15 Cash**
5. **1 Pilot Token** from shared supply (placed in Barracks)
6. **2 Engineer Tokens** from shared supply (placed in Barracks)
7. **2 Hydrogen Gas Cubes** (placed in Gas Reserve—enough for an immediate launch)
8. **3 Agent Tokens**
9. **Starter Deck** of 10 cards (shuffled)
10. **Set Income Track** to starting position (faction-specific, typically £5)
11. **Set Pilot Income Track** to 1
12. **Set Engineer Income Track** to 1
13. Draw opening hand of 5 cards

**Note:** Faction starting technologies (pre-printed on Player Boards) do NOT advance the Progress Track. Only Technologies acquired from the R&D Board during play count toward Progress.

## 11.3 First Player

Determine first player randomly.

---

# 12. IMPORTANT RULES CLARIFICATIONS

## 12.1 Technologies vs. Upgrades

- **Technologies** are acquired with Research and stored in your Drawing Office permanently
- **Upgrades** are installed on your Blueprint and return to the supply when removed or at Age transitions
- You must own a Technology to install its corresponding Upgrade
- Technologies carry across Ages; Upgrades do not

## 12.2 No Direct Attacks

There are no "take that" mechanics. You cannot directly sabotage or destroy opponents' ships. Competition comes through:
- Racing to claim routes first
- Outbidding for Technologies
- Controlling the most profitable routes

## 12.3 Loans and Bankruptcy

If your Income Track goes negative (from loans, Engineer upkeep, or route losses), you must pay the difference from your Cash at the start of each Income phase. If you cannot pay, you must discard Technologies from your Drawing Office (they are removed from the game) until solvent.

## 12.4 Network Connectivity

- **Age I:** No connectivity required (pioneer scramble)
- **Age II:** First ship must launch from Home Base; subsequent ships must connect to your network
- **Age III:** May launch from any Major Hub; subsequent ships must connect to your network

## 12.5 The Hindenburg Disaster

When a player draws a **Catastrophic Explosion** fire hazard during a Luxury Launch in Age III using Hydrogen:
1. The game end is triggered
2. Complete the current round normally
3. The player whose ship caused the disaster gains 3 VP (historical infamy)
4. Proceed to final scoring

## 12.6 Engineer Timing

- Engineers generate Research during the Reveal Phase: your total available Research equals the number of Engineers in your Barracks plus any Research bonuses from cards
- Engineers may be spent reactively after a Hazard Card is drawn to prevent crashes under certain circumstances
- Engineers spent during a Hazard Check do not generate Research that round
- Engineer upkeep (£1 per Engineer) is paid at the start of the Income Phase based on Engineers currently in your Barracks

## 12.7 Launch Outcomes

There are four possible outcomes when launching a ship:

**Success:** The ship reaches its destination. Place it on the route, increase your Income Track, and gain a city bonus from one endpoint.

**Aborted:** The launch fails but the ship survives. The ship returns to your Launch Hangar intact. Occurs when you fail a Hazard Check (ship stat + Engineers < Difficulty).

**Damaged:** The ship survives but needs repairs. The ship goes to your Repair Hangar (pay £3 at Construction Hall to move it back to Launch Hangar). Occurs when you control a fire by spending Engineers.

**Crash:** The ship is destroyed. The ship token returns to the shared supply and must be rebuilt at the Construction Hall. Crashes occur when:
- You fail to control a fire (don't spend required Engineers)
- A Catastrophic Explosion fire hazard is drawn
- A Critical Structural Stress hazard is failed

In all failure cases (Aborted, Damaged, Crash), the Pilot and any gas spent on the launch are lost.

## 12.8 Terminology: Slots, Swaps, and Tiles

- **Slot:** An empty space on the Blueprint where an Upgrade tile can be installed. There are four slot types:
  - **Frame Slot:** Accepts Frame tiles (structural skeleton). Each Frame slot shows a gas cube icon indicating launch cost.
  - **Fabric Slot:** Accepts Fabric tiles (outer covering materials)
  - **Drive Slot:** Accepts Propulsion tiles (engines and propellers)
  - **Payload Slot:** Accepts Payload tiles (cargo, passengers, equipment)
- **Swap:** One installation or removal of an Upgrade tile at the Design Bureau (one swap = one action)
- **Tile:** The physical component—either a Technology tile (stored in Drawing Office) or an Upgrade tile (installed on Blueprint)
- **Gas Cube:** A cube (Hydrogen or Helium) spent from Gas Reserve when launching to provide Lift (+5 each)

## 12.9 Victory Point Scoring

Victory Points are earned from **routes** and **Technology tiles**. All VP is scored at the **end of each Age** (before ships are removed), not at game end.

**Design Target:** Routes should contribute approximately **2/3 of total VP**, while Technologies contribute approximately **1/3**. This is achieved by:
- Increasing route VP values, especially for challenging routes
- Reducing Tech VP on highly useful technologies (you benefit from using them)
- Increasing Tech VP on niche/situational technologies (to compensate for limited practical value)

### Route Scoring

When an Age ends, score VP for each route you control. More challenging routes (higher Range requirements) are worth significantly more VP:

| Route Type | Age I | Age II | Age III |
|------------|-------|--------|---------|
| Short (Range 1-2) | 2 VP | 3 VP | 4 VP |
| Medium (Range 3-4) | 4 VP | 5 VP | 7 VP |
| Long (Range 5-6) | — | 7 VP | 10 VP |
| **Luxury Bonus** | — | — | +3 VP |

**Route VP Philosophy:** The harder the route, the greater the reward. Long-haul luxury routes in Age III (like London → New York) can be worth 13 VP, while short pioneer routes in Age I are worth only 2 VP.

### Technology Scoring

Technology tiles have **VP values printed on them** based on their practical utility:

| Utility Level | VP Value | Description |
|---------------|----------|-------------|
| **Essential** | 0 VP | Core technologies everyone needs (engines, frames, gas cells) |
| **Useful** | 1 VP | Good specialized technologies with clear benefits |
| **Niche** | 2-3 VP | Situational technologies with limited applications |

**The VP/Utility Tradeoff:** Highly useful technologies (like Helium Handling or Duralumin Framework) have 0 VP because their practical benefits are reward enough. Niche technologies (like Bomb Bay Design or Smoking Room) have higher VP to compensate for their limited usefulness.

**Note:** Technology VP is scored at every Age end, not just when acquired. Since Age I techs are scored 3 times, Age II techs 2 times, and Age III techs only once, earlier niche acquisitions accumulate more VP over time—but you sacrifice practical utility in the early game.

### Expected Score Ranges

| Category | Typical Range |
|----------|---------------|
| Route VP (all Ages combined) | 25-40 VP |
| Technology VP (all Ages combined) | 10-18 VP |
| **Winning Score (4 players)** | **40-55 VP** |

# 13. STRATEGY TIPS

## For New Players

1. **Don't Over-Engineer:** A ship that exceeds route requirements wastes resources. Build to spec.
2. **Balance Your Engineers:** More engineers mean more Research but higher upkeep costs. Find your equilibrium.
3. **Specialize Your Tech Tracks:** The discount for deep specialization is significant.
4. **Watch the Progress Track:** Every technology acquired hastens the game's end.
5. **Keep One Engineer for Emergencies:** You can spend them reactively to save critical launches.

## For Experienced Players

1. **The Germany Gambit:** High risk, high reward. Build monsters, but avoid Luxury Routes in Age III or accept the Hindenburg risk.
2. **The British Empire:** Your early Luxury stat lets you claim premium routes. Slow start on tech, strong finish.
3. **American Safety:** Your helium monopoly means you dominate Age III safely, and your purchases don't increase global Helium prices. Let Europeans bid up the market while you buy at stable prices.
4. **Italian Flexibility:** Your 4-swap Upgrade action means you can pivot instantly. React to what others are doing.

# APPENDIX A: TODO LIST — Design Work Remaining

The following items require finalization before the game is complete:

## A.1 Component Design

1. **The 3 Maps:** Create vector artwork for Age I (Western Europe), Age II (Europe at War), Age III (The Atlantic). Include:
   - Route lines with stat requirements printed
   - Luxury Route indicators for Age III
   - City names and icons
   - Route capacity indicators (single/double track)
   - Foundry icons for cities with industrial bonuses

2. **Player Boards:** Design the 4 faction layouts with:
   - Drawing Office with 4 technology tracks and pre-printed faction-specific starting technology
   - Blueprint overlay socket
   - Barracks for crew tokens (earned from shared supply)
   - Economy tracks (Income track only - no Research track)
   - Blueprint stat tracking area with cube tracks for: Lift, Weight, Speed, Range, Ceiling, Reliability, Luxury (each with min/max values)

3. **Blueprint Overlays (12 total):** Design 3 per faction with:
   - Frame slots and Fabric slots for structural components
   - Drive slots and Payload slots for systems
   - Different slot configurations per faction (see Section 10.5)
   - Clear slot type indicators (Frame/Fabric/Drive/Payload)
   - Historically accurate silhouettes:
     * Age I: Small, cigar-shaped non-rigid/semi-rigid designs
     * Age II: Longer, refined transitional rigid designs
     * Age III: Massive streamlined rigid giants with passenger gondolas
   - Faction-specific design elements:
     * Germany: Rigid Zeppelin configurations with max gas cell capacity
     * Britain: R-series designs with passenger comfort emphasis
     * USA: Military-influenced designs with robust structural elements
     * Italy: Semi-rigid designs with unique keel structures (Nobile pattern)

4. **Technology Tiles (~60):** Create tiles organized by track:
   - Propulsion: Engine technologies across Ages
   - Frame: Structural skeleton technologies (wood, duralumin, geodetic)
   - Fabric: Outer covering technologies (cotton, goldbeater's skin, gelatinized latex)
   - Gas Systems: Hydrogen improvements, Helium handling
   - Payload: Cargo, passenger, and mission technologies

5. **Upgrade Tiles (~80):** Create tiles corresponding to each Technology:
   - Clear visual link between Technology and its Upgrades
   - Stat bonuses, weights, special abilities

6. **Progress Track:** Design the shared track with:
   - Numbered spaces to threshold
   - Player count indicators for different thresholds
   - Thematic "fixed-wing aircraft" imagery

7. **Iconography:** Create distinct icons for:
   - Research (Lightbulb or Beaker)
   - Influence (Diamond)
   - Money (£ or Coin)
   - Pilot (Aviator cap)
   - Engineer (Wrench or Gear)
   - Gas (Balloon or Tank)
   - Lift (Up arrow)
   - Speed (Propeller)
   - Range (Fuel Gauge)
   - Reliability (Shield)
   - Ceiling (Altimeter)
   - Luxury (Champagne Glass)
   - Flammable (Flame warning)
   - Safe (Helium symbol)

## A.2 Card Design

1. **Personal Hazard Decks (24 cards each):** Each player gets identical deck. **RESOLVED** - See Appendix E for final distribution:
   - 4 Clear Weather (Auto-pass)
   - 8 Minor Hazards (Difficulty 2-3)
   - 6 Major Hazards (Difficulty 4-5)
   - 5 Fire Hazards (Hydrogen ships only)
   - 1 Mechanical Hazard (Critical Structural Stress)

2. **Market Deck:** Design 30 purchasable crew cards with:
   - Varied costs (2-6 Influence)
   - Mix of resource reveal icons (£, Research, Pilot, Engineer, Gas, Influence)
   - Cards that provide resources you can't easily get elsewhere
   - **RESOLVED:** Cards provide resources when revealed (see Section 8)

3. **Starter Deck Review:** Verify the 10-card starter deck provides:
   - Access to all Ground Board locations (mix of symbols)
   - Variety of reveal resources
   - Enough Influence to occasionally buy Market cards

## A.3 Economy Balancing

1. **Research Costs:** Balance Technology prices:
   - Age I: 1-2 Research
   - Age II: 2-4 Research
   - Age III: 4-6 Research
   - Specialization discounts: -1 at 3+ tiles, -2 at 5+ tiles
   - **Note:** Research tokens can be saved between rounds, allowing players to accumulate for expensive Technologies

2. **Engineer Economy:**
   - Starting Engineers: 2
   - Recruit cost: £4 per Engineer (see Section 6.1)
   - Upkeep cost: £1 per Engineer per round
   - Research generation: 1 per Engineer at Reveal
   - **Note:** Pilots cost £2 to recruit (cheaper because consumed on launch)

3. **Route Income Values:** Determine £ values for routes based on:
   - Distance/difficulty
   - Age
   - Strategic importance
   - Target: Ships should pay for themselves in ~3-5 turns

4. **Progress Track Thresholds:** **RESOLVED** - See Section 1.3 for complete table including Age transitions:
   - Age transitions at 8/16/20 (2P), 10/20/25 (3P), 12/24/30 (4P)
   - Test: Does game pacing feel appropriate across all Ages?

5. **Lifting Gas Market:** Set price scaling and:
   - Starting supply per Age
   - Replenishment rules
   - Faction-specific access (USA Helium monopoly)

## A.4 Gameplay Polish

1. **Age End Triggers:** **RESOLVED** - Progress Track milestones trigger Age transitions (see Section 1.3 and 9.1)

2. **Action Selection Mechanism:** Partially resolved:
   - Current system requires spending matching cards for worker placement
   - **RESOLVED:** Research Institute now allows purchasing Research with £ (see Section 6.1)
   - **RESOLVED:** Cards provide resources when revealed instead of being played reactively
   - Still needs testing: Is card-icon matching too restrictive? Consider Apprentice "Any" cards as wild

3. **Agent Count:** Determine appropriate number of agents per player after finalizing action spaces
   - Currently set at 3, but may need adjustment based on final action selection design

4. **Turn Order:** Define how first player rotates or changes

5. **Tie-Breakers:** Establish rules for ties in route claiming

6. **Player Count Scaling:** Adjust for 2, 3, and 4 players:
   - Available routes
   - Technology tile supply
   - R&D Board size
   - Progress Track threshold

7. **Hindenburg Disaster Tuning:**
   - Is +3 VP for historical infamy appropriate?
   - Does the fire roll trigger (rather than hazard check) feel thematically correct?

## A.5 Playtesting Priorities

1. **Engineer Economy Test:** Verify the tension between Research generation and emergency spending feels meaningful

2. **Progress Track Pacing:** Does the fixed-wing threshold create appropriate tension? Assess whether players avoid acquiring Technologies to extend the game, causing Analysis Paralysis. With reduced tech costs and saveable Research tokens, verify this doesn't cause runaway tech acquisition that ends the game too quickly.

3. **Technology/Upgrade Flow:** Is the two-step system (acquire tech → install upgrade) intuitive?

4. **Hindenburg Drama:** Does the Age III hydrogen risk create exciting decisions?

5. **Faction Balance:** Ensure no faction dominates across all Ages

6. **Age Transition Impact:** Losing Upgrades but keeping Technologies—does this feel fair?

# APPENDIX B: QUICK REFERENCE

## Phase Order (Each Round)

1. **Worker Placement:** Take turns placing Agents (play cards to visit locations)
2. **Reveal:** Show remaining hands, calculate Influence and Research
3. **Acquire Technologies:** Spend Research (Engineers + card bonuses + purchased) on Technologies
4. **Purchase Cards:** Spend Influence on Market cards
5. **Income:** Pay Engineer upkeep, collect £ from Income Track
6. **Cleanup:** Refresh R&D Board, check Age transition, refresh Agents, draw cards

## Build Checklist (Construction Hall Action)

1. ✓ Calculate Hull Cost: £2 base + Frame tile cost + Fabric tile cost
2. ✓ For each ship: Pay Hull Cost in £
3. ✓ Place built ships in your Hangar Bay (up to 3 per action)
4. ✓ Note: Physics Check NOT required to build—only to launch

## Launch Checklist (Launchpad Action)

1. ✓ Verify Physics Check (Lift ≥ Weight) AND all Frame/Fabric slots filled
2. ✓ Select a ship from Launch Hangar
3. ✓ Spend 1 Pilot (Barracks → shared supply)
4. ✓ Choose gas type (Hydrogen or Helium—no mixing)
5. ✓ Pay for Lifting Gas (Gas Reserve first, then market price for deficit)
6. ✓ Assign to valid route (must meet stat requirements)
7. ✓ Draw Hazard Card from your personal Hazard Deck
8. ✓ Compare Ship Stat to Hazard Difficulty (optional: spend Engineers for +1 each)
9. ✓ If Fire hazard and using Hydrogen: Spend required Engineers or crash
10. ✓ If Catastrophic Explosion on Luxury Launch in Age III: Hindenburg Disaster triggered
11. ✓ **Success:** Place ship on route, increase Income, gain city bonus
12. ✓ **Aborted:** Ship returns to Launch Hangar (Pilot and gas lost)
13. ✓ **Damaged:** Ship goes to Repair Hangar (Pilot and gas lost)
14. ✓ **Crash:** Ship destroyed (token to supply, Pilot and gas lost)
15. ✓ Continue launching more ships or stop

## Key Formulas

- **Hull Cost:** £2 base + Frame tile cost + Fabric tile cost
- **Physics Check:** Total Lift ≥ Total Weight
- **Lift Calculation:** Number of gas cubes × 5 (all gas types provide +5 Lift)
- **Gas Rule:** Choose Hydrogen or Helium per launch—no mixing within a single launch
- **Hazard Check:** Ship Stat + Engineers spent ≥ Hazard Difficulty
- **Research per Round:** Engineers in Barracks + Research icons from revealed cards
- **Engineer Upkeep:** £1 per Engineer in Barracks
- **Tech Cost:** Listed cost − Specialization Discount
- **Transition Income:** (£ from Tech tiles) − (£1 × routes lost), minimum £0
- **Repair Cost:** £3 per ship to move from Repair Hangar to Launch Hangar
- **Victory:** Most Victory Points wins (tiebreakers: Income, Cash, Ships on map)

## Gas Pricing (Gas Depot Action)

| Gas Type | Price | Lift | Fire Risk |
|----------|-------|------|-----------|
| Hydrogen | £1/cube | +5 | Vulnerable |
| Helium | £2-15/cube | +5 | Immune |

**Helium Market Track:** £2 → £3 → £4 → £5 → £6 → £8 → £10 → £15 (8 steps; stays at £15 if maxed)
**Price Increases:** Non-USA purchases advance the track by 1 per cube
**Price Decreases:** Ministry action reduces the track by 1 (minimum £2)
**USA Exception:** USA purchases do not advance the track (domestic supply)
**Age Reset:** Track resets to £2 at each Age Transition

## Game End Conditions

1. **Hindenburg Disaster:** Catastrophic Explosion during Luxury Launch in Age III (Hydrogen only)
2. **Fixed-Wing Rise:** Progress Track reaches threshold

## Scoring Summary (at end of each Age)

**Route VP (2/3 of total):**
| Route | Age I | Age II | Age III |
|-------|-------|--------|---------|
| Short (Range 1-2) | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| Medium (Range 3-4) | 4 | 5 | 7 |
| Long (Range 5-6) | — | 7 | 10 |
| Luxury Bonus | — | — | +3 |

**Technology VP (1/3 of total):** Score VP printed on each Technology tile you own (scored every Age). Essential techs = 0 VP, Useful techs = 1 VP, Niche techs = 2-3 VP

## Age Transition Income

> **New Income = (£ from Tech tiles) − (£1 × routes lost)**

Minimum £0. Technologies cushion the transition; routes cost £1 each when wiped.
