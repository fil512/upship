# UP SHIP! Rules Review (Updated)

## Summary

After incorporating your merged changes, many issues have been resolved. This updated review contains only **remaining issues** that still need attention.

**Remaining:** 6 balance concerns (for playtesting)

---

# PART 1: REMAINING BALANCE CONCERNS

## 1.1 Germany's Hindenburg Risk Relative to Other Flaws
**Concern:** While the Hindenburg trigger was improved (now only on roll of 6, not failed Hazard Check), Germany still has a significantly more punishing flaw than other factions:

| Faction | Flaw | Impact |
|---------|------|--------|
| Germany | Cannot use Helium | 16.7% crash risk per launch + can end game in Age III |
| Britain | 1 swap instead of 2 | Slower Blueprint changes |
| USA | -1 Lift per Helium cell | Minor efficiency loss |
| Italy | 1 fewer Payload slot | Reduced income potential |

**Consideration:** Germany's +3 VP for causing Hindenburg provides some compensation, and their Blaugas advantage is significant. The new fire roll trigger (only roll of 6 = catastrophe) is much better balanced than the original.

**Recommendation:** Monitor in playtesting. If Germany still feels too risky, consider:
- Blaugas also reduces fire risk by 1 (only roll 6 = fire, no "controllable fire" on 5)
- Germany starts with Fire Retardant technology

---

## 1.2 Hydrogen Fire Risk (33%) May Still Be High
**Concern:** For all Hydrogen users:
- Roll 5 (16.7%): Spend Engineer or crash
- Roll 6 (16.7%): Automatic crash

This 33% attrition affects every Hydrogen launch.

**Consideration:** This creates real tension and makes Helium valuable. The ability to spend Engineers on roll of 5 provides player agency.

**Recommendation:** Monitor in playtesting. If too punishing:
- Reduce to only 6 = fire event (16.7% total risk)
- Or Fire Retardant technology prevents BOTH 5 and 6 results

---

## 1.3 Research Institute vs Engineer Economy Revisited
**Previous concern:** Engineers might never break even compared to Research Institute.

**Update:** With Research tokens now carrying over between rounds, the calculation changes significantly. Players can accumulate Research over time, making Engineers more valuable for sustained technology acquisition.

**Status:** Likely resolved. Monitor in playtesting.

## 1.4 Income Track Negative Spiral
**Concern:** Section 12.3 says if Income goes negative, you must discard Technologies permanently to become solvent. This creates a death spiral:
1. Take a loan or lose routes
2. Income goes negative
3. Forced to discard Technologies
4. Lose upgrade capabilities
5. Ships become uncompetitive
6. Cannot recover

**Recommendation:** Add safety valves:
- Allow selling Technologies for £ (to bank) instead of discarding
- Limit negative income effects: "Discard at most 1 Technology per round"
- Or add "Emergency Funding" Ministry action: trade 5 VP for £10

---

## 1.5 Technology VP Scoring Creates "Niche Tech Rush" Incentive
**Mechanic:** Technology VP is scored at every Age end. A 3 VP Age I niche tech = 9 VP total over the game.

**Consideration:** This is intentional design tension—players must choose between useful but 0 VP technologies vs niche but high VP technologies.

**Recommendation:** Monitor in playtesting. The reduced tech costs should make it easier to acquire both types.

---

## 1.6 Insurance Bureau Income Cost
**New mechanic:** Insurance now costs Income Track reduction instead of flat £.

**Consideration:** This makes insurance a long-term investment decision. Each policy permanently reduces income but provides crash protection.

**Question:** Is there a limit? A player could theoretically reduce Income to 0 and hold many policies.

**Recommendation:** Consider adding a minimum: "You cannot reduce your Income Track below 0 through insurance purchases."

# PART 2: PLAYTESTING NOTES

All mechanical issues and clarifications are now resolved. The remaining balance concerns above should be monitored during playtesting.

# APPENDIX: RESOLVED ISSUES

The following issues from the original review were resolved in the merged changes:

## Numerical Issues Resolved
- **Engineer Recruit Cost:** Standardized to £4 (Section 6.1, Appendix A.3)
- **Starting Cash:** Fixed at £15 for all player counts (Section 2.1)
- **R&D Board Tiles:** Scale by Age (4/5/6), not player count (Section 4.1)
- **Market Row Cards:** Fixed at 5 cards (Section 11.1)
- **Technology Tile Count:** Updated to 47 after Frame/Fabric split (Appendix C, D)
- **Britain's Swap Count:** Confirmed as 1 instead of 2 (Section 10.2)
- **Italy's Strategy Tip:** Already correct at 4-swap (Section 13)
- **Research Cost Ranges:** Updated to match actual tiles: Age I 1-2, Age II 2-4, Age III 4-6 (Appendix A.3)
- **Helium Lift Scaling:** Changed from fixed +5 to +3/+5/+7 by Age (always 1 less than Hydrogen) (Section 4.4, Appendix B, D)

## Mechanical Gaps Resolved
- **Gas Reserve Usage:** Fixed to say "launching" not "building" (Section 3.5)
- **Ministry Action:** Defined as "Draw 2 cards, discard 1, go first next round" (Section 6.1)
- **Insurance Bureau:** Now costs Income Track reduction (Section 6.1)
- **Weather Bureau:** Now allows discard option (Section 6.1)
- **Hand Size:** Clarified "draw until you have 5 cards" (Section 6.3)
- **Hazard Deck Management:** Added discard pile rules (Section 7.3)
- **USA Home Base:** Added Age III base (Lakehurst, NJ) (Section 10.3)
- **Faction Blueprint Slots:** Added summary table (Section 10.5)
- **Research Tokens:** Now carry over between rounds (Section 4.1, 6.2)
- **Hull Cost Formula:** Defined as £2 base + Frame tile cost + Fabric tile cost (Section 7.1, Appendix B)
- **Gas Consumption & Pricing:** 1 gas cube per Frame slot; Hydrogen £1/cube; Helium market track £2-£15 (Section 4.4, 6.1)
- **USA Helium Advantage:** USA purchases don't advance the Helium Market Track (Section 6.1, 10.3)
- **Gas Depot Strategic Note:** Fixed "building" to "launching" (Section 6.1)
- **Frozen Prototype Rule:** Added explicit rule that ships on routes retain launch stats (Section 3.2)
- **Pilot/Engineer Income Track Setup:** Added to player setup (Section 11.2)
- **Technology Bag Accumulation:** Clarified that tiles from all Ages accumulate in bag (Section 4.1)
- **Engineer Hazard Spending:** Standardized to +1 per Engineer for all hazards; removed card-specific abilities (Appendix E)
- **Semi-Rigid Keel +1 Lift:** Removed erroneous Lift bonus; now only Weight -2, Reliability +1 (Appendix D, Section 10.4)
- **Pressurized Lounge Restriction:** Clarified "Requires Helium Gas Cell installed" (Appendix D)
- **Pioneer Scramble Conflicts:** Added turn order cross-reference (Section 5.1)
- **Route Claiming Priority:** Added Section 6.1 cross-reference for turn order (Section 5.5)

## Clarity Issues Resolved
- **Crash vs Aborted:** New Section 12.7 defines terminology
- **Slots/Swaps/Tiles:** New Section 12.8 defines terminology
- **Hindenburg Trigger:** Now only on roll of 6, explicitly Age III only (Section 7.5, 12.5)
- **Researcher Card:** Updated with conditional effects (Section 8.3)

## Balance Adjustments Made
- **Hindenburg Disaster:** Changed from -5 VP penalty to +3 VP reward (historical infamy)
- **Technology Costs:** Reduced across all Ages (Appendix C)
- **Hindenburg Trigger:** Narrowed to only Catastrophic Fire roll (6), not all failed Hazard Checks
